  SIL_war_on_the_past:0 "War on the Past"
  SIL_war_on_the_past_desc:0 "John Doe is waging a war on the past, and the past is winning. Once the greatest warlord of the American Anarchy in the Northwest, John Doe's Silk Path has been reduced to a rump state near the Seattle coast. Although the city itself is too broken to be of much importance, it has been designated as ground zero of the extermination of the ancient culture that has led the people of this continent to ruin. According to John Doe, there is sin in America's past, and the only way to escape it is by extending the human lifespan. Naturally there has been pushback against these radical measures, the most notable of which are the two delegations from Central and ARC. Until these intruders are dealt with, John Doe must contend with a petty territory on the periphery of the continent."
  SIL_the_immortality_theory:0 "The Immortality Theory"
  SIL_the_immortality_theory_desc:0 "The Silk Path is searching for a dream unseen. The search for immortality, as old as Sumeria, as sought after as the darkest secrets of the world. The Silk Path rejects clinical immortality as a temporary solution to a far bigger problem: the sickness known as aging. So far, there have been minor advances in maintaining tissue and mind cohesion, thereby extending the average follower lifespan beyond the century. However, the treatment for extended life is extensive and restricted to John Doe's close circle.\n\nAn enigma. A philosopher. A savior. A fleeting memory of the old world.\n\nThese are just some of the words used to describe John Doe, the most mysterious man in North America. His first appearance in official records was in 2148, when a Central probe team reported that he had amassed a small following in Oregon, mostly consisting of mercenaries. After a brief firefight between Central forces and bandits, John Doe was caught and imprisoned alongside other petty warlords. The guards noted that he was already an ancient man then, likely in his 80's. No fingerprints could be taken due to his prosthetic hands and the prison was abandoned before further studies could take place. John Doe left and slipped into obscurity.\n\nIt was not until 2161 that John Doe resurfaced, this time at the head of a small army of fanatics. His face had become obscured by an esoteric mask and few knew of his real identity. When Central initiated the Northern campaign in 2166, John Doe was one among many of the petty warlords who resisted their advance. But the years dragged on and petty settlements fell. Eventually, John Doe's realm, once stretching from the Pacific to the Rockies, was reduced to small hideouts near the coast.\n\nJohn Doe's followers are almost as elusive as the man himself, but a few captured initiatives have spoken of mystifying things: John Doe and his close circle of "Chrysalids", or local elites, are searching for the cure to aging. Myths speak of the man's true identity and one can only wonder what his ancient eyes have seen... and what lies behind that iron mask."

 #Events
  silkpath_event.1.t:0 "Time"
  silkpath_event.1.d:0 "Passed down by Kiera Lanchet, [GetDateText]\n\nTime has slowed down to a crawl. The days blend into one long journey, and I have lost track of time. The hour hand of the clocktower on Democracy Island has been broken off by a stray shell, and it only tells minutes. I do not remember crawling into my basement at night. Sleep feels like an ancient art lost in the foggy past. I leave for work at early dawn, when the orange sun begins its slow climb upwards. The debris and ruins of Seattle no longer draw my attention, yet I cannot help but feel a pain deep within my heart when passing by a body. It is not the sight of a dead person, split in half by a shell, or torn apart by hungry mobs, that disgusts me, but the fact that I have to force myself to feel pity for the dead. The horrors of yesteryear have calmed into a necessary sight, then into ignorable bumps on the periphery.\n\nMy work is relatively straightforward: I ferry papers between John Doe and his staff. The constant bombardments have forced our leaders into different camps around the city, so that the destruction of one does not claim too many lives. On good days I am assigned a guard or two, but I try not to venture too deep into the city. My idle time is spent in John Doe's encampment not far from home: it is a bunker from the war, long emptied of any usable equipment of utility or comfort. When I first began working for Doe (it feels like an eternity ago), I used to rush between the shadows of buildings, my heart pounding with pressure, ready to give out at the sight of a scavenger just behind the corner. But these days I take my time. Some semblance of order has returned to the streets, and the soldiers distribute canned food now. Before entering the bunker, I look to the East and watch the gilded sky in hopes of... something. I do not know what I am searching for yet. Doe knows it too, I think, but he is often silent.\n\nThe war against the Union delegations is going well, I hear, yet it feels so very far away. Yesterday, after handing Doe a report from the front, he came out of the bunker. The papers themselves were locked, but his eyes had changed when he read them - I can only guess the fighting will die down in the coming months. Doe muttered something to me and walked up the stairs and into the sunlight. I watched him from the bunker below, standing in the rays of sunshine as he stretched out his mechanical arms. Time did not seem to be an issue for him - he remained standing there long after the other staff had left. I saw him looking up at the sky when I packed my rations and went home for the night. Alone, beneath the corpses of skyscrapers, John Doe seemed like such a small man."
  silkpath_event_option.1.a:0 "I guess that's all he was."
  silkpath_event.2.t:0 "Nothing Inside"
  silkpath_event.2.d:0 "Passed down by Kiera Lanchet, [GetDateText]\n\nYou know, whoever you are, reader, some people look hollow. Before the events of last year, I would have considered this a grand, but preposterous statement. My life in Union territory was never really my own, and I myself feel empty. Living in luxury (or, at least, relative luxury) makes one more susceptible to planning. I remember imagining all that I was going to do once: become a researcher, find cures for century-old sicknesses, maybe even enter the history books. The old world felt real, and yet somehow, now that I live in the dirt and walk past mortar craters each day to work, life feels unreal. The rations have lost their taste, the pain of glass in your skin has faded. I find myself thinking more and more, reflecting through an internal voice that overpowers everything around me.\n\nBut anyway, now that I have lived two distinctly separate lives, I feel that I have the experience to categorize people into three categories:\n\nFirstly, there are those who are full, but it is a false fulfilment. These are people who look forward towards a greater objective. They live passable, and sometimes even good lives, but I see very few of them here.\n\nSecondly, there are the people who are filled with air. These ones are really hollow, but they like to pretend that they are not. They speak of grand schemes and weave words in such a way so as to inspire others. The man who calls himself the Phoenix is one of them - I rarely seem him by John Doe's side anymore. His role as a preacher of the Silk Path has consumed him fully - the Phoenix might as well not have a mask, for he is not a person, but an ideal, I think. I pass through the crowds that form around his podium every so often, crowds of people who want more and will do anything to have more. Some believe the Phoenix when he says that the past is a terrible lie and must be destroyed. Others cheer him on when he yells for the Union delegates' heads. Many yet remain silent.\n\nAnd lastly there are the hollow ones, those like John Doe. They are truly empty, because when you look into their eyes, you see nothing. I have faced scavengers in whose eyes burns a wild desire to live, I have gazed into the pupils of orators on gigantic screens as they conjure powerful scenes, and I have looked in the mirror a long time ago. One night I got help up with some paperwork and was left alone with Doe in his bunker. The lights had gone out automatically, and just as I was about to leave, I looked back to check on him. He was just sitting there, arms dangling on his sides, staring blankly at the wall opposite his desk. The moonlight coming in through a crack in the ceiling illuminated his face, and I watched it. Infinite time passed, but he never looked at me, never acknowledged my presence. Whenever he blinked I felt like the ground itself shake. His pupils did not dilate, his chest did not rise when he breathed. "Is he judging me?" I wondered then, "Or is he lost inside himself?""
  silkpath_event_option.2.a:0 "If a shell hit us then, I do not think he would have cared."
  silkpath_event.3.t:0 "Dim Fires"
  silkpath_event.3.d:0 "Passed down by Kiera Lanchet, [GetDateText]\n\nThe people of Cascadia have developed an uncanny dialect, stretching their vowels ever so slightly. The change is inaudible to a foreigner, but I know it when I hear it, for I myself am beginning to pick it up. The land itself is transforming me, I think, into something recognizable but no longer my own. My anchor when I first arrived here were the other Centralists, who had come to fight the warlords. The Union delegations are unlike them now, and they are very few, but every so often I hear one among the crowds. The sound of American speech is like a time machine, throwing my mind back into places I shall not recount here.\n\nAnyway, among the Centralists whom I have found, I was pleasantly surprised to spot one among John Doe's head staff. He is called Enkidu, and he hails from distant Denver. Like the rest of the Chrysalid inner circle, most of his face is covered by a breathing mask, yet he stands out from the others. I see it in the way he carries himself: his movements are strict, mechanical, driven by some desire. I asked Maira and Fred about him, and they dug out some records. Apparently, Enkidu was an officer in "Roger's Villains", a Central volunteer battalion back in the third civil war. I do not know why he serves John Doe now. There are rumors that Enkidu joined the Chrysalids willingly after losing a political struggle within his unit. Others say that he was mortally wounded, and that Doe's technology saved his life. Personally, I don't think that it matters much. No matter his background, the Enkidu is just an army man, and nothing else. I doubt that anyone in Central will take him back in, yet I doubt his conviction even more. We are alike, him and I, in some ways. Both from a far off land, both alone, but I have slowed down. The rising sun is shining as I write this, and soon I will leave to bask in its light. It's an ephemeral pleasure, but nowadays it is all I look forward to. But Enkidu is different. He is not hollow, and somewhere inside him, I sense a burning flame. Even now, it consumes him, scorching his innards while his mind races. I can see it in his fast movements, the way he only speaks the absolute minimum, in the fact that he ignores John Doe and John Doe ignores him."
  silkpath_event_option.3.a:0 "There is something to Enkidu, but what it is I do not know."
  silkpath_event.4.t:0 "The Killing Man"
  silkpath_event.4.d:0 "Passed down by Kiera Lanchet, [GetDateText]\n\nSometimes I feel like a ghost, floating over a desolate rock. The people around me walk with lowered heads, fixated on the tiny debris shards in their path. The leaders of the Silk Path are always in different places, concealed behind masks and ceremonial robes. They remind me more of children playing dress-up than technocrats or governors. They do not notice me when I drop off the papers at the foot of their shrines to life itself. I fear that I am forgetting how to speak - yesterday I tried to talk to the earth inside my basement, straining to give it form in my mind. Am I going mad? I have attended the Phoenix's speeches over the course of the last month, but they are not directed at the listeners - the Phoenix talks into the air, as if rejoicing at his own speech craft. The listening mob is but a set piece. I report to the Enkidu this week, but more often than not, I find him brooding in the corner of his bunker, oblivious to those around him. He is a man trapped in a world of his own, I believe.\n\nBut the strangest of all is the one person who acknowledges my existence: the one Doe calls "Draugr". I only see him every other Friday when I deliver new programs to his abode, a small shack situated on a hill overlooking the city suburbs' remains. He is missing both eyes, and yet he welcomes me when I tiptoe in without knocking. Truth be told, he makes me uneasy. There is a plethora of cold machinery that runs from a large computer and into his body. Wires are his clothes, tubes are his ways of communicating. So far I have only caught a glimpse of his head: his face is, naturally, behind a mask, but is also somehow animate. His eyebrows move when he talks, his head rotates like an owl's, his voice is imbued with an uncanny combination of joy and terror. Whenever he speaks, his words bend in unnatural ways - I do not recognize his accent, and do not dare remain long enough in his presence to uncover its origin. The Draugr chuckled the first time I entered his home. I hadn't noticed the camera hidden behind an old drawer before he screamed "Hello!" and a claw dangling from the ceiling beckoned me further inside. Hit hut was modest in size, only one floor, but I could visually trace where all of the machinery led: the wires stretched from generators and into the Draugr, his computer, and the terminal. At first I thought he was playing some kind of simulation, but as I got closer, I saw that the screen was a visual transmitted from some drone. The man was piloting it remotely, casting missiles at buildings and mowing down those below. It took me a while to recognize that the location - he was killing people right in Seattle! I had heard rumors of enemy drones launching nightly raids on the outskirts, but here it was, a leader of the Silk Path, bombing his own people. I did not know what to make of it - I turned and saw his empty eye sockets looking at me. He was laughing and choking simultaneously, and I hurried outside. I dare not speak of what else I saw in his home."
