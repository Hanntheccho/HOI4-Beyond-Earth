 ENG_Jolly_Old_England:0 "Jolly Old England"
 ENG_Jolly_Old_England_desc:0 "The end is in sight. We entered this conflict with the hope of neutrality and to save ourselves from the chaos, but the end is in sight, and a final confrontation is taking place. We are battered, bruised and exhausted, but the same can surely be said for our opponent.\n\nWe must not back down. Not now. One final push, and England might yet be saved."
 ENG_Muster_The_Nation:0 "Muster The Nation"
 ENG_Muster_The_Nation_desc:0 "In spite of all odds, England is free. Free from the clutches of foreign influence, and free from the tyranny of the extremism that has claimed all around us.\n\nWe can at last take a moment to celebrate, but we cannot be ignorant to the work that lies ahead. The continental powers may be cast out of our beloved island, but the Scottish still pose a very real threat and will no doubt return to avenge their embarrassing defeat. We must be ready."
 ENG_Against_The_North:0 "Against The North"
 ENG_Against_The_North_desc:0 "Just as we feared, the Scottish are mustering for an invasion. No doubt humiliated by our victory, they are the only foreign power in a position to avenge their loss. We must make all preparations possible to retain our triumph, even if our decisions will be bitter to swallow."
 ENG_England_Alone_And_Triumphant:0 "England, Alone And Triumphant"
 ENG_England_Alone_And_Triumphant_desc:0 "This is our final fight. The corruption of the old regime is returning and showing its true face. We don't face the lackey anymore, we battle against the puppet master himself.\n\nWe cannot hope for total conquest, only to wear them down long enough that they are forced to accept defeat and withdraw. They cannot afford a long war of reclamation, and they know it."
 ENG_I_Shall_Not_Cease_From_Mental_Fight:0 "I Shall Not Cease From Mental Fight"
 ENG_I_Shall_Not_Cease_From_Mental_Fight_desc:0 "It's over. Finally. From the ragged militia holdouts in Kent and Cornwall, we have defied every vile force on these Isles, and we remain. We can breathe, and we can live. At last, England is free and England is safe.\n\nThere is much to be done."
 ENG_Nor_Shall_My_Sword_Sleep_In_My_Hand:0 "Nor Shall My Sword Sleep In My Hand"
 ENG_Nor_Shall_My_Sword_Sleep_In_My_Hand_desc:0 "The time has come. It has not been long since the idea of a figurehead monarchy was leaked to the public, but the wave of slowly growing support we have received is extremely emboldening. After a series of public announcements, interviews and press conferences on the matter, the Prime Minister has announced a formal, digital referendum on the matter. The question is simple: Shall England remain a Republic, or become a Constitutional Monarchy for the modern age?"
 ENG_Til_We_Have_Built_Jerusalem:0 "'Til We Have Built Jerusalem"
 ENG_Til_We_Have_Built_Jerusalem_desc:0 "We are not a nation that desires war. We have fought to cast out the tyranny of the extremes from our country, and we seek nothing more than to preserve those ideals. To do so in today's turbulent world, however, requires a military deterrent that can stand up to all aggressors. As a wise soul said long ago, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick'."
 ENG_A_Revised_Army:0 "A Revised Army"
 ENG_A_Revised_Army_desc:0 "England is a nation with a proud history of military professionalism. From the New Model Army of Cromwell to the SAS of the United Kingdom, England's military has always been a staple of quality over quantity. With our newfound independence, it is time we built up a safeguard against those who might strive to take it from us so soon, and to rebuild the English army into guardians of our new nation."
 ENG_Global_Development_Contracts:0 "Global Development Contracts"
 ENG_Global_Development_Contracts_desc:0 "England's Air Force has been effectively inert since long before the Civil War, doing nothing but fly in air shows and other mundane tasks. A revitalisation of the Air Force will be necessary to defend the skies over England."
 ENG_Officer_Culture:0 "Officer Culture"
 ENG_Officer_Culture_desc:0 "It has been many years since England has truly made use of its armed forces, but following the recent civil war, the repulsion of the Scottish and the increase in global tensions, it is a certainty that we will need to defend ourselves again in the future. Through our experience in the Civil War, we have a new generation of competent military leadership that can take us forward in reforming our army to better suit modern warfare."
 ENG_Oxford_Institute_of_Technology:0 "Oxford Institute of Technology"
 ENG_Oxford_Institute_of_Technology_desc:0 "As a pleasant side effect of our newfound independence, we are no longer limited to the market sphere of our Scottish ex-overlords. To the construction and military production firms of the wider world, England is a fresh field ready to be reaped, and some lucrative contract offers will start up the machine of our military reconstruction."
 ENG_Military_Infrastructure:0 "Military Infrastructure"
 ENG_Military_Infrastructure_desc:0 "No Description Found"
 ENG_ReEstablish_the_Air_Force:0 "Re-Establish the Air Force"
 ENG_ReEstablish_the_Air_Force_desc:0 "It can be said that flocking to the winning side is an act of cowardice. Despite that, there were many moderates from the other factions of the Civil War who defected to us when our position in the conflict became more tenable. This, in our minds, proves our superior position to the extremists and radicals we were against. To reinforce this idea among the public, we can find examples of these defectors and make their stories public."
 ENG_A_Cavalier_Constitution:0 "A Cavalier Constitution"
 ENG_A_Cavalier_Constitution_desc:0 "Accountability and trust is extremely important in any form of authority. Through a cycle of accountability, we will ensure that nobody is without a voice, and everyone is responsible for their actions. Local police will be monitored by a humanitarian committee, whose members will be elected as part of local elections, and the police will, in turn, keep the general populace safe. With everyone having someone to watch and everyone having someone watching them, abuse of authority and police brutality can become a thing of the past, and crime can be reduced."
 ENG_The_Charlotte_Program:0 "The Charlotte Program"
 ENG_The_Charlotte_Program_desc:0 "It's no secret that we rule over a population who hardly knew who we were before the war, let alone expected us to succeed. Most are set in their old ways of extreme politics and divisive thought, and it is up to us to show them what Cavalierism is, as most of them have hardly any idea of the concept. Let us hope we make a good impression."
 ENG_Reinstate_MPs:0 "Reinstate MPs"
 ENG_Reinstate_MPs_desc:0 "Constitutions are a wonderful thing. A clearly outlined document that describes the principles of a nation, the extent and limitations of authority and the rights held by its law abiding citizens. To ensure our legacy endures, we shall pen a constitution that upholds the individual rights, enshrines free debate as a part of our nation and prevents abuse of authority."
 ENG_Right_To_Disagree:0 "Right To Disagree"
 ENG_Right_To_Disagree_desc:0 "Named after the Prime Minister's dearly departed mother for her role as a leading figure in championing for the rights of ex-convicts and for her advocacy for reform-based incarceration, the Charlotte Program is a multi-step reform system for prisoners from the recent civil war.\n\nBy reintegrating into society through steps such as finding consistent employment and testifying against their superiors in units convicted of criminal actions during the war, prisoners can eventually complete the program to earn total amnesty, barring any outstanding war crimes, without any public record of their participation in the war in the hopes they will be swayed to put their trust in our new government through our leniency."
 ENG_Civil_Liberties_Motion:0 "Civil Liberties Motion"
 ENG_Civil_Liberties_Motion_desc:0 "The fact of the matter is, not all of our enemies in the old government had power and self-interest in mind. Barbara Taylor herself was an outspoken advocate of change, even if it was far too late and far too little, and it must be remembered that she held consistent and loyal supporters within her own party who hailed her anti-corruption efforts.\n\nAll NLP Members of Parliament were suspended following our victory in the civil war, but through a brief vetting process, we can reinstate those who were found to not fall victim to the rampant corruption of the old government."
 ENG_Watching_The_Watchers:0 "Watching The Watchers"
 ENG_Watching_The_Watchers_desc:0 "A luxury that was lost long ago, political nuance is something the modern world sorely lacks. To disagree is to be 'The enemy', and to show sympathy for the merits of another viewpoint is to be seen as unequivocally evil. Humanity's tribal instincts are a great beast to overcome, but we must try. While we cannot outright ban arguments, we can encourage debate and reason as core tenets of our ideology and hopefully sway the populace from extremism. Violence will never be the answer, and to throw the first punch is to admit defeat."
 ENG_Englands_Green_and_Pleasant_Land:0 "England's Green and Pleasant Land"
 ENG_Englands_Green_and_Pleasant_Land_desc:0 "It has taken great effort and many compromises, but England's industry is flowing again. We can finally stand on our own two feet, independent of foreign meddling and free of the exploitation of malefactors."
 ENG_Raise_Up_Defectors:0 "Raise Up Defectors"
 ENG_Raise_Up_Defectors_desc:0 "The old, World War 2 Era visual of the stoic British officer walking into danger without a hint of fear is one that England held proud, long ago. Now, almost nobody thinks anything of the modern English army. While we cannot simply enforce a return to old culture, we can encourage a more active and respectable role from the Officer corp in our new armed forces. The English soldier of the modern day will not be a rugged, no-nonsense military thug, but a stoic, honest, respectable, Cavalier individual."
 ENG_Imperfect_Balance:0 "Imperfect Balance"
 ENG_Imperfect_Balance_desc:0 "No Description Found"
 ENG_Rebuilding_Homes:0 "Rebuilding Homes"
 ENG_Rebuilding_Homes_desc:0 "We have lost much. Not only in the civil war, but in the decades of old. Since the seas rose and our nation slipped from our hands, the once proud industry of England has slipped away into irrelevance. But all is not lost. Free from the tyranny of foreign pockets, we can begin to not only rebuild, but to come back stronger. England will stand on her own two feet once more."
 ENG_Heavy_Industry_Program:0 "Heavy Industry Program"
 ENG_Heavy_Industry_Program_desc:0 "Our nation was won by the efforts of brave militias and dauntless individuals. The common person is the driving force of any nation, and in one working so hard to rebuild, the government can always use more hands. For those still unemployed, we can offer helpful "Stepping Stone" programs in the military, working to rebuild the country or provide humanitarian aid to those most impoverished."
 ENG_HighDensity_Housing:0 "High-Density Housing"
 ENG_HighDensity_Housing_desc:0 "No Description Found"
 ENG_Repurpose_European_Designs:0 "Repurpose European Designs"
 ENG_Repurpose_European_Designs_desc:0 "While the idea of being able to throw money at any problem is nice, our economists are sweating at the notion. We have a lucrative, more open market now that England is free from foreign domination, and it is time we made something of ourselves to turn a profit. Investments in Heavy Industry will not only allow us to be more self-sufficient, but will aid immensely in reconstruction efforts."
 ENG_Employment_Incentives:0 "Employment Incentives"
 ENG_Employment_Incentives_desc:0 "The city of Birmingham is known for its sprawling slums and impoverished outer districts, the population of which was quick to side with the extremists. With their situation, they cannot personally be blamed, and we will show our benevolence by addressing their concerns forthwith. Not only will the homes destroyed in the civil war be rebuilt, but new housing districts will give the impoverished masses a place to call home and be proud of."
 ENG_Restart_Trade_Agreements:0 "Restart Trade Agreements"
 ENG_Restart_Trade_Agreements_desc:0 "No Description Found"
 ENG_A_Steady_Heartbeat:0 "A Steady Heartbeat"
 ENG_A_Steady_Heartbeat_desc:0 "The end of the civil war put us on something of a blank canvas diplomatically. None of the foreign meddlers we repelled are particularly happy with us, but the fact that our nation is now neutral and no longer in the pockets of any of their rivals means that the possibility for renewed diplomacy still exists. We will negotiate as equals, not as the lesser partner in any political alliance."
 ENG_Military_Employment:0 "Military Employment"
 ENG_Military_Employment_desc:0 "The unfortunate side effect of excessive welfare is that after long enough of relying on it for sole income, many people just do not see a reason to return to work when they can live off of government payments. Through generous social and bureaucratic benefits, we can offer the unemployed work in government programs such as helping to rebuild wartorn areas of the nation or helping to improve and establish local businesses."
 ENG_The_Doves_Claws:0 "The Dove's Claws"
 ENG_The_Doves_Claws_desc:0 "Constructed as an extension of the prestigious Oxford University, the Oxford Institute of Technology is rapidly becoming a centre of technological progress in Europe."
 ENG_A_Strange_Proposal:0 "A Strange Proposal"
 ENG_A_Strange_Proposal_desc:0 "No government system is perfect. Democracy can be weak and slow to action. Extensive individual rights can lead to a struggle to uphold order. Loops of accountability can lead to a Byzantine bureaucracy. But these are risks we accept gladly for the good that they bring. Democracy may be slow, but it acts on the will of those it represents. Law may be harder to uphold, but an individual should be free to choose their destiny. Our bureaucracy may be complex, but the alternative is unchecked abuse of authority. The burden of doing good is lessened by the sight of good itself."
 ENG_Assure_The_Voters:0 "Assure The Voters"
 ENG_Assure_The_Voters_desc:0 "The Prime Minister has proven by now that he has the interests of the English people at heart, and many are willing to listen to his ideas for a new England. It seems he has been waiting for this, however, and has set in motion a very unusual proposition: The restoration of the House of Windsor, albeit in a powerless, entirely advisory position with much less of the Pomp and Circumstance of old. This is a blatant gamble for the Prime Minister and his popularity, as backlash could severely damage the good will he has built up with the people, but he truly believes that an eccentric figurehead could be just what England needs to rally around in these dark times.\n\nA conversation by the PM about the topic has been intentionally "leaked" to the press, with the intention of gauging the opinions of the public. Time will tell where this gamble leads."
 ENG_The_Referendum:0 "The Referendum"
 ENG_The_Referendum_desc:0 "After the leaked comments from the Prime Minister, a large national debate has begun over the idea of a restored, figurehead monarchy. Some see the idea as unnecessary and absurd, while others are convinced by the government's ongoing successes, spurred on by the spirit of revitalised English independence. If we intend to continue down the path towards a figurehead restoration, we will need to make our intentions and ideas for this new monarchy clear, and to deny any links to the overly expensive, undemocratic, corrupt system of old."
 ENG_I_Will_Not_Cease:0 "I Will Not Cease"
 ENG_I_Will_Not_Cease_desc:0 "War and death are upon us. Never did we think the turmoil would come to this, and we are not the ones who have cast the first stone, but we are left with no other options.\n\nMinister Burr has chosen not to take a side in this conflict, and his supporters stand behind him in securing themselves from the chaos consuming the land north of our holdouts. In refusing to pick a side, however, we have made ourselves an unwitting fourth contender to this chaos.\n\nWe find ourselves squarely in the sights of the Devil himself; John-Hall and his purists will not hesitate to bring our attempted neutrality to a swift and murderous end. For the sake of us all, we must fight. If it means risking everything to bring peace to England, so be it."
 ENG_Against_The_Front:0 "Against The Front"
 ENG_Against_The_Front_desc:0 "In such ruinous turmoil as this, only hope drives us onward. Hope for a better tomorrow. A tomorrow that the past once thought inevitable. For the sake of all that is good, fight! Fight for England!"
 ENG_The_Few_Who_Dare:0 "The Few Who Dare"
 ENG_The_Few_Who_Dare_desc:0 "Minister Burr knows the Front all too well. Their hate, their depravity and their vile demagogue, John-Hall. By their words and by their fists, they are to blame for this violence and death, and they must be stopped. Even if we may not emerge the victors of this new civil war, we have a duty to avenge England's pride. To take them with us."
 ENG_Hope_Glances:0 "Hope Glances"
 ENG_Hope_Glances_desc:0 "We cannot count on foreign meddling to win us the day. We are the only ones who refused to sell our souls to the greater powers, and the only ones to fight against them all. While this may have made us enemies, it has also made us friends. Like-minded people who dread the path England is taking, and see our cause as hopeful and just. They bring with them supplies, weapons, and most importantly, souls to stand against the chaos. We will need every pair of hands that can be mustered, and we are eternally grateful for their trust in us."
 ENG_Towards_Birmingham:0 "Towards Birmingham"
 ENG_Towards_Birmingham_desc:0 "The Lion is dead, slain by the arbitrators of justice. This victory means more than just a sigh of relief for England; it shows the world that our cause has strength, and our people are brave and capable.\n\nOur success has no doubt attracted the attention of the remaining contenders for the nation who surely shrugged us off as a distraction for the Front, and they will not take kindly to our elevation as a serious threat to their power. We must not stop here, we cannot. If we can defeat the Front, we can defeat them."
 ENG_Against_The_Spring:0 "Against The Spring"
 ENG_Against_The_Spring_desc:0 "The 'legitimate' government of England is nothing more than a collection of corrupt bureaucrats wading in the blood money that subservience to the North Sea Alliance has gotten them. They have never cared for England, and even the attempts of Prime Minister Taylor to 'fix' the nation, noble as they might appear to be, are far too late. To seize Birmingham will mean not only our greatest victory yet, but a massive boost to our prestige and legitimacy in the eyes of the nation."
 ENG_Unto_The_Breach:0 "Unto The Breach"
 ENG_Unto_The_Breach_desc:0 "Hope for the future is something that we share in common with the English Spring party, but their means do not justify the ends. While we preserved our political independence and were willing to compromise with our opponents, they have effectively enslaved themselves to the will of INTEGR and the Germans, and their methods have become more and more radical and extreme in recent years. Focusing our efforts against them will allow us to not only eradicate their extremist methods, but to potentially gain defectors from those who might be sympathetic to our cause among their ranks, and ready us for a final assault on the New Parliament."
 ENG_Our_Place_In_A_New_World:0 "Our Place In A New World"
 ENG_Our_Place_In_A_New_World_desc:0 "It is done. With time and perseverance, the Cavalier England we have sought for so long is here, and we can finally sit back and be proud of all we have accomplished.\n\nAs always, there is more to be done, but this will not be rebuilding or winning over the hearts of our people. This will be securing our place in this turbulent world through outstretched hands, in the hope other like-minded nations might be willing to share in a new friendship built on mutual defence from the hawks of this world."
 ENG_The_Global_Defence_Organisation:0 "The Global Defence Organisation"
 ENG_The_Global_Defence_Organisation_desc:0 "Now that our independence is assured and our nation is rebuilt into a new, Cavalier visage, it is time we looked out abroad. Though the conflict that spawned our ideals was fought for the desire for independence, rising tensions across the world mean we cannot simply outlast the storm by clinging to our raft. We will need allies, and we will need an organisation to muster beneath."
 ENG_Our_LikeMinded_Underdogs:0 "Our Like-Minded Underdogs"
 ENG_Our_LikeMinded_Underdogs_desc:0 "The Global Defence Organisation is not merely another Military Bloc. It is an extranational pact of mutual assistance and cooperation that places no single member state above any others. Unlike INTEGR, we are not dominated by any single hegemon. Unlike the Pan-Asian Cooperative, we are not a superpower's attempt at proclaiming false unity. We are a true agreement of nations to further one another's mutual benefits, and to ride out the storm of the coming future."

 ENG_Contact_The_Americas_desc:0 "No Description Found"
 ENG_Reach_Out_To_Asia:0 "Reach Out To Asia"
 ENG_Reach_Out_To_Asia_desc:0 "The North American Union is a fragile entity. While we cannot pick apart individual districts from their wider conflict, there are several minor players on the outskirts who may be interested in membership. We must be careful, however, that we aren't dragged into a wider conflict with the NAU."
 ENG_Allies_In_Africa:0 "Allies In Africa"
 ENG_Allies_In_Africa_desc:0 "No Description Found"
 ENG_European_Prospects:0 "European Prospects"
 ENG_European_Prospects_desc:0 "Brewing conflicts in South America have left several minor states wary of their future. Should we desire their membership, we should step in before any greater power sets their sights on them"
 ENG_The_GDO_Deterrence_Program:0 "The GDO Deterrence Program"
 ENG_The_GDO_Deterrence_Program_desc:0 "The expansion of our alliance is complete, and we stand with as great a roster of nations as we can hope to have. Now that our nations are coordinated in their stance against the other powers of the world, it is time we further advanced our mutual assistance and invited our member nations to a grand summit in order to discuss further measures."
 ENG_United_Research_Initiatives:0 "United Research Initiatives"
 ENG_United_Research_Initiatives_desc:0 "As part of our military cooperation efforts with our new member states, the GDO Deterrence Program seeks to provide all members with an equal share of a collective investment. All members will donate a percentage of their GDP into one of several investment funds, with the end result being that each member sees the same returns regardless of their own income. This allows the smaller states among us to be able to better defend themselves, and encourages the mutual cooperation the organisation is founded upon."
 ENG_Economic_Unity_Plan:0 "Economic Unity Plan"
 ENG_Economic_Unity_Plan_desc:0 "Given our ideals of mutual defence and strategic coordination, it seems reasonable to also begin to coordinate our research efforts as a collective force. No member state will hoard technological advancement while others suffer in ignorance. Our knowledge should be shared in the interest of mutual security and collaboration."
 ENG_Further_The_Alliance:0 "Further The Alliance"
 ENG_Further_The_Alliance_desc:0 "Not all of our members have particularly strong economies. In the interest of ensuring that every member of the GDO can contribute, the Economic Unity Plan seeks to encourage member states to provide aid to those who struggle in certain economic fields, while giving more freedom for members to focus on their economic strengths."
 ENG_From_Many_One:0 "From Many, One"
 ENG_From_Many_One_desc:0 "Though the GDO was founded on the preservation of independence against foreign powers, it is clear that the developing situation across the world may call for a more directly involved system. We have already rolled out numerous economic and military unity schemes that have helped to bring the alliance together…but it seems more may yet need to be done."
 ENG_Liberation_Of_The_Old:0 "Liberation Of The Old"
 ENG_Liberation_Of_The_Old_desc:0 "Though our organisation was not originally born from these ideas, the necessity of the hostile world around us means that we must evolve. But this is not the 'evolution' of old. We will not be a bloc of extremism, radicalism and militarism. We are a bastion of hope, united for something better. Cavalierism will not just be an English concept, but a global one. One that means stoicism in the face of dark skies. One that brings the honest people of the world together in hope for the bright days long lost. A concept that well and truly cares."
 ENG_The_Birmingham_Summit:0 "The Birmingham Summit"
 ENG_The_Birmingham_Summit_desc:0 "The initial expansion of our alliance started out with nations in the Balkans, but we believe there are greater possibilities if we continue our diplomatic efforts on the continent to make our foothold there more reliable."
