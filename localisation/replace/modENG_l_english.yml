  ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia:0 "The Sick Man of Britannia"
  ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia_desc:0 "In 2200, England is a starkly divided nation. It began as ignorance when the Thames began to climb, and the official response was to just put a wall around it. By the time London was drowning, the wolves revealed themselves. Now, England's new capital in Birmingham has met almost a century of inefficient, contentious rule, and anyone can feel the rising tension. The vultures circle overhead, and England's fate rests on the shoulders of foreign powers."
  ENG_stagnant_republican_army:0 "Stagnant Republican Army"
  ENG_stagnant_republican_army_desc:0 "When a limping England was accepted into the North Sea Alliance, the nation breathed a sigh of relief…and immediately cut its military funding to prop up its struggling economy. With the burden of defence placed on its new allies, England's coffers flooded elsewhere as she struggled to stand on her own two feet again. Though the Republican Army still exists, its equipment and methods are woefully outdated, and despite the severe state of the nation, diverting any funds to restore the army is not going to come without a lot of opposition."
  ENG_incompetent_parliament:0 "Incompetent Parliament"
  ENG_incompetent_parliament_desc:0 "Ever since Parliament relocated to Birmingham, the change seems to have only ramped up their childish incompetence. Petty issues consume days in needless debate, funds for lifesaving aid are going to the vices of lying MPs, and things actually getting done are cause for national celebration. Same as it ever was, yet somehow worse."

 #Leaders
  ENG_barbara_taylor:0 "Barbara Taylor"
  ENG_barbara_taylor_desc:0 "The "New Labour Party" of Barbara Taylor desperately scrambles to catch the pieces of a crumbling state alongside their benefactors in the Highlands. With Taylor herself, a union worker before her time in politics, at the helm of a government who spends its time squabbling and sitting blinded within the confines of the city of Birmingham, she is the one the population blames for the decades of inadequacy and incompetence, and her efforts to correct course and save the nation from despair may only tip it over the edge.\n\nAdvocates of industrial renewal and embracement of the future, it is the Masterist decree that England can only survive if it is to push ahead with vigour, a stiff upper lip and the recovery and alteration of what remains. After all, the Industrial Revolution was born in Birmingham, and so, one might hope, a Masterist Revolution may yet march on from there too."
  ENG_arthur_barr:0 "Arthur Burr"
  ENG_arthur_barr_desc:0 "Arthur Burr is a man of eccentric character, but solemn, grounded resolve. When his family's modest fishing life was replaced by the roar of a new, Scottish-made Industrial Trawler, he grew to resent the ruling party and its industrial overlords in the Highlands.\n\nWhen his mother was sick and dying, and the medicine to save her life was unavailable when an English Spring protest had its manufacturer closed down, he rejected the idealism of the Harmonists.\n\nWhen he was poor and living in a Newcastle slum, an English Front rally beat him to unconsciousness when seeing his prosthetic hand that replaced the one lost to an industrial accident, he cast out the blind hatred of the Purist.\n\nAnd so, to Arthur, the world had betrayed him. But the eccentric Burr would not let the world around him bring him to ruin. To, as an old adage put it, “Keep Calm and Carry On”. It was this determination that brought him to others like him who held similar tales. Similar disdain for factionalism. For the low that decades of rule had brought them to, and the danger that the alternatives might sink them even lower. But unlike his comrades, nihilism was not enough for Arthur Burr. He sought to do something about the world around him, and so rallied his supporters behind what he described as "Cavalierism". He did not fight for an ideology or a foreign benefactor. He fought for England. He did not espouse harsh Masterism or naive Harmonism. He espoused the spirit of England. He did not hope for a technological salvation, nor did he hope for an impossible recovery. He hoped for England, and that her people might finally see the error of their ways. That England might finally stand on her own two feet and proclaim herself a sovereign, free land, even after the decades of blood, toil, tears and sweat."
  ENG_cassie_kenney:0 "Cassie Kenney"
  ENG_cassie_kenney_desc:0 "England is not dying, England died a long time ago. England died with the drowning of London. England died when the rest of the world died. Yet there are those in power who seek to escape drowning by tying an anchor to their feet. There are warmongers who would subjugate these fair, floundering isles. There are fools who would refuse to release their pride for the good of the people.\n\nCassie Kenney hails from a valley in Lancashire. Or rather, she once did, before her home had flooded six times in a decade. Before the government's inaction left her family without food, water or electricity. Before a starving young teenager beat her boyfriend to death in the night when they were robbed, only for the burglar to find an empty fridge. Before the desolation forced her to move to Birmingham, where she saw the fire of industry burning bright. Cassie did not blame the teenager for her boyfriend's death, just as she does not blame the river for rising. She saw the problem at its core. The government. The "Masterists". The people who continued to poison the land, even as it was sinking beneath them. Cassie founded the Lancashire section of the Spring Party, but only a year later, she was voted as the leader of the entire, nationwide party. She saw the path forward, and it would not be through inaction.\n\nEngland's corpse is blindfolded, but the Spring can see it through the dark. It is all they can hope for."
  ENG_nigel_john_hall:0 "Nigel John-Hall"
  ENG_nigel_john_hall_desc:0 "What is England anymore? England is a bloated corpse, and all around, it is defiled. The so-called "New Labour Party" attaches machines and lights to watch it twitch. The "Harmonists" seek to decorate it with flowers and pretend all is well, and the "Cavaliers" would perform a ritual of salt and candle to resurrect it.\n\nNo. England is long-dead, and only the great can avenge her.\n\nEnter Nigel John-Hall, founder of the English Front, Republican Army veteran and, according to the "government" in charge, now designated a terrorist. He, who wishes to lead England free of her course of degeneracy and technological rape. He, who fought for the people and received a pension of trinkets and meaningless praise. He, Nigel Barton Ibrahim John-Hall, a terrorist.\n\nNo. They are the terrorists. The defilers of English pride and beauty. The match is struck, and England will crawl from this black abyss, or Nigel will fall screaming with it."
  ENG_peter_clement:0 "Peter Clement"
  ENG_peter_clement_desc:0 "Peter Gordon Clement, born in 2137 in a rural northern English town called Rothering, emerged from a working-class background. Raised in a family known for their colorful language, Peter faced personal challenges when his grandfather's health declined. Despite being told that it was "the right time" his grandfather's prolonged suffering left a lasting impact on the young Peter. Following in his father's footsteps, Peter pursued carpentry and eventually relocated to Birmingham. In the 2150s, he found work as a stagehand for Channel One, focusing on set design.\n\nPeter's journey took a significant turn in 2158 during Channel One's First Annual St. Fanny's Hospital's T.V. Fundraiser for Dying Children. Due to unexpected circumstances, the event encountered numerous obstacles, with transportation disruptions and frustrated participants. Seizing an opportunity, Peter was reluctantly thrust into the role of producer by the event's host, Graham Bannon. Despite his initial reservations, Peter proved his competence by orchestrating a remarkable turnaround. With an passionate speech, he united the cast and crew, ensuring the show's success and the collection of the much-needed funds.\n\nThis achievement propelled Peter into the limelight, earning him country wide recognition. Leveraging his carpentry skills, he became the host of a popular home improvement and D.I.Y. show titled "Just the Job" in the early 2160s. The show achieved tremendous success, garnering numerous accolades during its 11-season run. It was during this time that Peter crossed paths with Ivan Vodovich, the current President of the Balkan Federation, and Julia Salisbury, a London lawyer, during a conference. These encounters laid the foundation for future collaborations.\n\nBy the 2180s, Peter ventured into politics, assuming co-leadership of the "Advance" political party alongside Julia Salisbury. Their shared vision encompassed wealth redistribution and enhancing citizen welfare, striving for a fairer society. With his background in carpentry, television, and philanthropic endeavors, Peter Gordon Clement emerged as a dynamic figure in British politics, dedicated to championing social justice and improving the lives of the people."

  pre_cw_england_event.2.t:0 "A Right Honourable Panic"
  pre_cw_england_event.2.d:0 "In the PM’s office of the Birmingham Town Hall, the so-called ‘New Parliament’, Barbara hadn't even stepped out of her office since last morning, and all that could be heard from inside was that incessant tapping of a keyboard. She had a small Crowley installed in her desk - that tiny little dispenser for flavoured drinks - but it had long since run dry, and its incessant ‘low fluid’ beeping had hardly helped her nerves.\nHer desktop computer was the only light in the office, aside from the sunrise creeping through the closed blinds behind her. A few hours ago, she had set an alarm on her phone for every hour on the dot. More than half of the times it had gone off, she had fallen asleep in her chair.\nThe words on her screen felt like they had dissolved into a blur, and she could hardly make out the flood of emails that demanded responses over the sound of her own pounding head. There was no caffeine in those damn drinks. And so for just a second, she laid back. Thought on it all. The damage, the death, and the chaos. The leaders of the two largest opposition parties, the Spring Party and English Front, had both resigned in protest. Hardly two months after her election. Perhaps it would be an opportunity to just… get away from it? They were already calling for her to resign with their votes of no confidence, so… why not take them up on it? It was the perfect opportunity, and her headache pleaded for her to take the easy way out. To maybe… leave the country. Ask the Scottish if she could try her luck over there..? \n\n…But then she would be a national disgrace. If the country got worse, which she knew it would, she would be blamed for the rest of history as having kicked England over the edge. She could save this. Save her country; even when there was so little left to salvage.\nNo… she couldn’t turn back, not now. She came here to fix this failing state, and she’d go down with it if she had to. She closed her eyelids just to let them rest a little from the unpleasant screen light…"

Pictures from the 21st and early 22nd centuries, depictions of England with its borders containing the last not lost to the rising sea.\nOf course, when talking about Cassie Kenney, ‘young’ was subjective; she was in her mid thirties. But compared to other members of Parliament, she was the youngest by far.\n"Every method of legitimate opposition has been outlawed or cast away! Even John-Hall and his bands of fascists-" She paused as she was drowned out by booing crowds at the mere reference of the name. "-Even his fascists are sick of Barbara Taylor!"\nShe turned around to a nearby news drone that was hovering overhead, looking directly into its camera."\nDo you hear us, Taylor!? We won’t stand for another minute of the NLP’s reign and their failed regime! Do you hear us!?" She stepped aside to let the drone see the vast crowd gathered in the streets of Newcastle. At the sight, they collectively cheer in a vast, drowning sea of anger and resentment. The Drone is suddenly grabbed as Kenney turns it to face her, crouching down to peer into the camera.

  pre_cw_england_event.4.d:0 "In a small bungalow on the rural fields of Oxfordshire, Nigel John-Hall took a deep breath… and exhaled a cloud of thick, puffy, apple flavoured smoke. He felt that audible, uncomfortable hum of his hearing aid turn up its sensitivity and braced himself for the unpleasant beep from his electronic cigarette, complaining that it still needed a refill. It had been empty a week now, but he could still just about get the flavour out of it.\nPutting the small tube-like device onto a small glass table beside his armchair, he leaned forward to stand…\n”Do you need help, NIGEL?”\nThat fake tone of pleasantry blurted out of his ‘home carer’, a rubbish bin shaped robot no higher than his waist, given to him by the government before they gave less of a damn than they did now.\n”Quiet, you bloody bean tin shitbox.” He grunted as he got to his feet, taking a hold of his cane. He despised being old. Past your eightieth birthday, everybody was so patronising. You couldn’t breathe without some virtue-seeking prat coming out of the woodworks to do it for you.\nHe had only woken up a few hours ago, having publicly declared his unemployment from Parliament the day before to his many followers. Now, he wondered if he might expect his rallying call to bear fruit. He made himself some toast. Butter and marmalade. A coffee, one sugar. Doctor said it was bad for him at this age, but that was the same doctor who would read from the same newfangled ‘analysis output’ screen as everyone else rather than actually learn how to treat somebody.\nFinally, he walked to the front door, adjusted his posture a little…and his eye caught the portrait hung up beside him. It was crooked – poor Benjamin didn’t deserve that. He righted it…and adjusted the ring on his finger a little. He still missed him.\nHe raised a hand…and pulled the door open. Immediately, he was met with a wash of cheers as the tension of the crowd outside was finally relieved. He stood straight, stepped out onto the porch…and smiled."

Even weeks later, the streets were still awash with litter and ruin, but she couldn’t say if that was normal or not. She wasn’t sure what had and hadn’t been torn apart by an angry mob, it all looked the same now. The ruined factories. The squatter warehouses. The chimneys of outdated steel mills half-toppled in the decades without maintenance.\n”Busy night, Barbs?” The man spoke up behind her. Tim Belley, that insufferable little idiot. She had evidence he had been sucking funds out of their relief efforts for at least twelve years, and she couldn’t bear the little weasel on a personal level. “The lads are goin’ out for a drink at six.

While it had certainly revealed the weaknesses of the current government, it had the likely unintended side effect of giving the Prime Minister the leeway to take any action she found fitting, with no cohesive opposition in place. And so soon enough, some of the less influential or more ’outspoken’ ministers had found themselves out of a job by the end of the week\nOf course, removing the loudest nay-sayers would hardly fix the country, and this obviously had the potential to make the backlash even worse, but to be voted out now would be to end this crusade before it even started.

It was fairly radical for its time - an all-encompassing economic mandate that England's energy must be completely sustainable and renewable within a decade, including vast legal requirements to effectively outlaw harmful emissions and unsustainable practices.\nOf course, radical or not, it came far too late, and though it saw initial implementation, it was only some years later that it was abandoned at the turn of the Great Mistake. Declared a failure- not because of circumstance- but due to its own faults; pushed away as an ‘impossible ideal’.\nTo those in power and those who reject such ideals, this was a necessary effort to mediate the worst of the Great Mistake. But to the voices in the English Spring party, it was a poorly veiled attempt to disguise the government’s ineptitude at enacting what could have helped save the planet. A betrayal of not simply the people, but the world itself.\nAnd it is these same voices who call for what has become known as a ‘New English Spring’. A reform not of mediation, but of repair.\n“The world has already fallen down the abyss, and Cassie Kenney seeks to throw the rope that might one day pull its people free.”"

With the Great Mistake, however, the English military had effectively become inert, existing only as an internal peacekeeping force or as a manpower asset for relief efforts. The Republican Navy was nothing more than a trade escort fleet, and the Republican Air Force hadn’t done anything but perform exercises for centuries.\nSo it has been on until the 23rd Century, where the Republican Army is just a weight for the NLP to swing around, the Republican Navy is all but taken up by trade obligations to the North Sea Alliance, and the Republican Air Force barely surpasses a few hundred planes. Unused and neglected, its veterans naturally grew resentful. Army pensions were nothing but trinkets nowadays, and a complete disregard for the state of the army has left its members hateful of the ruling government, and of the progression of the world around them. How long until their menial labour is replaced with some other new machine? How long until the Army is disbanded outright?\nIt’s no surprise, then, that the members of the ‘English Front’ are mostly those in the military. It’s no surprise that they flock to the oldest of veterans, Colonel Nigel John-Hall. Nor is it a surprise that they have been described as almost ‘paramilitary’."

His father was a fairly apolitical man, his mother had been an avowed Harmonist, and his Uncle had been a fanatic member of the English Front.\n\n…Yet Arthur was leader of the Liberal Democrats. A party which had quietly endured throughout the turmoil. A party whose word was taken as nothing more than quiet resentment that could easily be ignored. And despite all that came against him, he endured. Despite how his family business was ruined by government industry. Despite how he was brutally beaten for his cybernetic left hand. Despite how his mother had passed away due to a Harmonist-led ban on the manufacture of the medicine she needed. Despite it all, Arthur Burr never abandoned his principles. Principles of proper democracy. Of an English spirit that was not drowned in hate and jingoist ideas. Of a future that did not lean on impossible ideals. Of a sensible government that truly cared. England had an identity, and no outside power nor fanaticism of the future could take that away.\n\nOne could call Arthur Burr the last moderate in England."

The man was drowned out by another chorus of support, but it was distinctly muffled. Deadened enough that he could tell it was no majority. But despite that… he continued. He was no coward, and not a man who backed down against popular opposition.\nArthur Burr was a bastion of a party that hadn’t been free of popular suffocation in decades, and calling someone a ‘Liberal Democrat’ in Parliament was synonymous with calling them an outcast nowadays. But Burr pushed on nonetheless.\n"I call that this house immediately issue a Motion of No Confidence-" Again, he was drowned out by the rambling calls of approval and anger from both sides. "-A Motion of No Confidence not simply against this government, but against the Prime Minister herself, for this blatant disregard of the ruling system and of the democratic voice of the English people!"\nDespite the hurling of accusations and insults over her head from the squabbling groups… Barbara Taylor simply sat back in her seat opposite the man whose shallow husk of a party was all that remained in opposition. She did not rise to defend herself, nor did she show any smug confidence. She knew she had no need to stand and deflect the accusations, as they were entirely true, and either way, wasting her breath on a defence would make no difference. The motion was doomed to fail weeks ago."

  pre_cw_england_event.14.d:0 "In a time long forgotten, the National Health Service had been a respected institution. Public, free healthcare to all British, and later English citizens, funded by the government. It fostered generations of well respected, if often underappreciated doctors, nurses, paramedics and others devoted only to saving lives.\nBut with the Great Mistake and the gradual decline of England, the NHS was first overstretched, then underfunded, then bypassed completely as its position and obligations were slowly stripped away. Now, the National Health Service is nothing but a group of underpaid General Practitioners and nurses who offer little more than basic treatment or mundane prescriptions as their equipment and authority becomes outdated with the needs of the modern era.\nBut despite that, the funding for the NHS remains high, and anyone with an eye for the methods of today’s government can see why. Money falls into the pit with the NHS stamp, but only trickles and pennies reach those who need it.\nThe NHS served its purpose well in years past, but it has come time to let it fade into history in service of a better tomorrow."

"Shit-"\nShe dried herself as quickly as she could and threw on the rest of her clothes. That meeting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer had taken forever, the mumbling old pillock. She was just about dressed and ready by 11:58, blessing every force alive that she had remembered to load up the useless, out of date software the Scottish wanted to have this meeting with.\n\n"Prime Minister! Can you hear me alright?"" Spoke the burly, bald, big-nosed man on the other end. "Yes, Mr. President," Taylor replied with that cheery, plastered smile. Such was the formal greeting of the post-information age. "Sorry to call you at your lunch break, but my schedule’s full for a month in both directions!"\n"Aye, I can imagine."" Hughes paused to take a bite of his fried potato lunch, and Barbara could only hide her petty jealousy at the sight. She hadn’t had a lunch break since last year.

But finally, after a spirited and noble fight, the last true rural English pub has been ordered to close its doors.\nDespite the local outrage, most are aware there is nothing to be done. In just a week, the building is to be cleared and made ready for demolition.

"Of course not, Prime Minister…"\n\nThe two, or perhaps just the one, given how Minister Brey was internally fearing for the security of his job, looked out from atop a Birmingham skyscraper over the vast, rebuilt and fully operational factory district on what were originally the city’s outskirts. Its existence had not come without some kind of outrage. The Harmonists were upset about its pollutant output, the Purists were angry about a few jobs being lost, and the increasingly vocal Liberal Democrats, those irrelevant whiners, were mad about all  of those things, and more.\nOf course…nothing could be done to silence the uproar now.

  england_event.1.t: "The Birmingham Uproar"
  england_event.1.d: "It began with a few drunken old men in a Birmingham pub. As is English tradition, they would typically have voiced their distaste of the state of affairs to one another, and then done nothing more. But now, that tradition had passed by one too many times, and from a few more drinks came a drunken brawl with a police officer on the street. From that brawl came the officer's reinforcements, and from that reinforcement came outraged onlookers to intervene. Soon, the entire local police force was mustered to the area, against the opposition of what looked to be a dozen city blocks, fueled by decades of dissatisfaction and quiet resentment boiling to the surface.\n\nBy the end of the hour, the city was awash with violence. It was not clear to many why exactly they were hurling rocks at police lines or firing rubber bullets over poverty-riddled crowds, as the attention and goal of the crowd was volatile at best. Electric gates had been set up in town squares, with riot pens filled beyond capacity to the point there were riots within the riot pens themselves. Attempts at deploying aerial drones to fire chemicals into the crowd only served to arm them further as rocks, cans and even makeshift cannons made from overcharged B-D tennis ball launchers were used to shoot them out of the sky, those same chemicals being thrown back at the police lines just minutes later. By the late hours, a formal request for use of high-frequency speakers and mass chemical dispersal had been made, but dismissed by the PM personally.\n\nIt was only when the chaos had started to die down that an understanding of the riot's main ideology was ascertained. By the end of the day, the famous statues of Boulton, Watt and Murdoch, founding figures of the industrial revolution, had been…"

  england_event.2.d: "Violence erupted today on the streets of Birmingham following a slow collapse of central authority by the English Government. After the Great Mistake, England's economy and status as a European power was quick to decline, and in recent years, the nation has become reliant on the North Sea Alliance both politically and economically for stability.\n\nFollowing the eruption of a large riot in the streets of the capital city several months ago, the building tension across the nation has divided the people across several ideological lines. In the east, advocates of the 21st century 'English Spring' seek to rebuild the nation under strong ecological ideals in line with INTEGR. In the Home Counties, frustration with the technological shock of NSA integration has brought rise to a paramilitary of anti-technological militia under ex-general Nigel John-Hall, and in the south, a small force of breakaway militia under MP Arthur Burr hold the regions of Kent and Cornwall.\n\nTime will tell if the old government can withstand the storm, or if England will be swept away under a tide of long-boiling discontent."

  england_event.3.t: "Government Victory in England"
  england_event.3.d: "With the surrender of the last pockets of insurrectionist resistance, the government of Barbara Taylor’s New Labour Party has declared victory in the 2nd English Civil War.\n\nElected several months before the outbreak of fighting, Barbara Taylor was a dark horse among the notoriously stagnant New Parliament in Birmingham, and while some say her attempts at drastic reform only sped up the approach to conflict, the attempt alone places her as an outlier among the long-standing inaction of the New Labour Party. Large scale crackdowns both in the government and across the nation are currently taking place, with heavy industrial revitalisation scheduled in the near future.\n\nIn a brief speech to Parliament, the Prime Minister affirmed her commitments to reform and to the North Sea Alliance. Already, NSA troops are entering the country to help quell lingering resistance, putting to rest any concerns that England may yet slide into the sphere of another European power."

Though the French and German lackeys may have been expunged, the Scottish across the border are less than pleased with our government. While we have promises of continued support and cooperation, we cannot ignore the fact that this government fell into civil war mere months after its founding, and we must restore the NSA’s trust in our leadership if England is to become anything of note."

  england_event.5.t: "A Moment of Reprieve"
  england_event.5.d: ""Cheers!"\nThe word came out as a surprise to the members of Ms. Taylor’s inner circle. Before and during the civil war, the PM had been an overworked, exhausted husk of a shell who said not a word of anything that wasn’t strictly required for her to say. For her to raise the first glass was perhaps more motivational than they would have expected.\n"To our hard work, our brave army, and the prosperity of England." A rowdy grumble of cheers fell from her associates. The toast was perhaps the first of many to be so honest before the new century. What was once a toast to coffers and personal health, now something for a greater good. Barbara downed half her pint in a few seconds – the first she had allowed herself in months. As the glass sank back to the table, her eyes caught their own gaze in the grimy orange liquid. She fell silent, and contemplative. Thoughts crossed her mind.\n\nIt could have been any other of them sat here right now.\nThat rowdy people pleaser, Kenney.\nThe old oatbag and his luddite maniacs.\nEven Burr, the poor bastard.\n\nBut it was none of them. She focused herself back to reality and took her gaze off her drink, back to her compatriots. Men and women she could trust. Who really cared for England as she did. Now, it was their time. Hers."
  england_event_option.5.a: "Maybe things will be alright."
  england_event.6.t: "The Hopeful"
  england_event.6.d: "Cassandra Kenney was a divisive figure in England. To most before the Civil War, she was a well-meaning, if somewhat radical political figure. After its outbreak, however, she was discredited by many for rising up in armed revolution, overturning democracy for violence. Now, defeated and ashamed, she languishes in a prison in Leeds, her conditions decent, but her connection to her beloved supporters severed like the heart from a body.\n\nThe government would soon decide what was to be done with her. What few letters she could send to the Prime Minister seemed to vary almost manically. In some, she lambasted her captors with excessive punctuation and capital letters, damning them for their betrayal of the planet and its people. In others, her tone is heartfelt and honest, wishing to apologise for casting aside her principles in favour of a violent uprising. She is a conundrum at best, an unstable revolutionary at worst.\n\nAll that remains is what to do with her, and the example that will be set by her fate."

  england_event.7.t: "The Hateful"
  england_event.7.d: "Of all the opposition to the government during the civil war, few were as dangerous and hateful as Nigel John-Hall. His status as an ex-army veteran and his charismatic populism have made him perhaps the single most dangerous man in the country, and even now, imprisoned with his fellow terrorists in Leeds, he makes calls to continue the struggle. Unlike his fellows, John-Hall was not given the opportunity to send any letters nor make any pleas, and his conditions were distinctly worse than most, owing to the general hatred for him outside the ranks of his own fanatical supporters.\n\nThis is hardly a surprise, given the long list of atrocities committed by his forces. While John-Hall himself denies or denounces these actions, the perpetrators themselves undertook them in his name, the most heinous of which included murders committed when vital cybernetic implantations were torn from the bodies of the sick and elderly in their hospital beds, arson of entire street blocks funded by membership in the NSA, and lynching of those with any visible augmentations, not to mention the masses of terroristic strikes against new factories and datalink sites, some of which occurred before the civil war even began.\n\nWe cannot be certain all of these claims are true, but it is impossible to deny the distinct ruthlessness and violence carried out by the English Front’s forces, and many are calling for the harshest possible punishment for their leader."
  england_event_option.7.a: "Make an exception to the death penalty laws, and have him executed by the army for treason. He is a veteran, after all."
  england_event_option.7.b: "He must face a life sentence, as short as that may be."

  england_event.8.t: "The Dutiful"
  england_event.8.d: "Arthur Burr, still technically a member of Parliament, has found himself an odd case for the government. While currently considered a terrorist, and having undoubtedly led an armed opposition to the government, he still retains a surprising amount of popular sympathy, and compared to other combatants, his ‘Cavalier’ militia have very few accusations of crimes levied against them.\n\nBurr himself writes regular letters from prison in Leeds, many of which call not for continuation of his ideology, but for his supporters to lay down their arms and seek change through reform now that England is stable again. He regularly claims his actions were only in the interest of saving the country from violent extremists, and despite his blatant disdain for our leadership, he claims to be at least grateful that we were the ones to triumph, and not any other. He has even recently sent a letter to the Prime Minister herself, formally apologising for his opposition and seemingly throwing around the idea of returning to Parliament.\n\nDespite his claims of good-heartedness and his admittedly clean record, it cannot be forgotten that this man was willing to lead an armed opposition to our government when the nation was in crisis, but the benefits of his acquittal, and of extending an olive branch to his support base must be considered."
  england_event_option.8.a: "Mr. Burr’s record may be mostly clean, but we cannot stomach opposition at a time like this. He will remain in prison."
  england_event_option.8.b: "His actions must still be answered for. A short sentence and suspension from politics will put the troublemaker away."
  england_event_option.8.c: "His ‘Cavalierism’ isn’t all that harmful of a concept. Release him, and reinstate him as a member of Parliament."

Finally, the back breaking work was over. New authority had been handed out across England, the matter of the opposition had been settled, provisional authority was being relinquished, and the country was slowly returning to a status quo.\n\nIt felt like a lifetime ago that she had been hearing the first hints of news about a small scuffle in Birmingham. Ever since that point, she had been tumbling arse-up, down a hill of smoke and blood. But now, she had reached a plateau. Stability. The word seemed so luscious and tender, she could hardly believe it to be a state one could achieve. But here they were. Safe. Stable. A moment of bloody peace.\n\nHer phone rang, and she could swear she felt a vein burst. She let it ring for a few moments. Just to imprint into her mind what it felt like to actually be laying in a bed. Then, once she had enough of a taste of peace to torment herself, she rolled over to the nightstand and picked up her phone.\n\n’D. Hughes.’ She had only spoken to him intermittently over the course of the war. At least then, she had the excuse to cut the call whenever something ‘important’ came up. Or whenever she was just sick of his blunt attitude. But now, there was nothing. He was catching her with nothing else to occupy her time, and he surely knew it.\n\nShe let the phone ring right up until it would have gone to voicemail, and only then did she answer. From the depths of her soul, she summoned a pleasant voice that had no right to exist."

  # england_event.10.d: "Before the gradual decline of England into corrupt complacency and unrest, ambitious plans had been made by joint NSA research and engineering teams for a project that could recover much of England’s lost history, pride and industry, known by its experimental name as an ‘ARK’ Project. Similar plans are a hallmark of the NSA’s goals and ambitions for the future - to rebuild Europe and recover her lost cities.\n\nAnd London, fate willing, would be among them.\n\nThere now lies the question, however, of who will fund and construct this ambitious work. Though England may be free from her turmoil for the moment, the Scottish role in our victory is not to be understated, and they will surely be looking for a piece of this lucrative investment. While Scottish cooperation is to be expected in this project, we must be sure that a new London does not lie in the pockets of over-involved foreigners."

The new Frontist government has already begun extensive crackdowns across the nation, and martial law has yet to be lifted and Parliament, effectively abandoned since the fall of the old government, is expected to be abolished in the coming days, and a new radical military government installed.\n\nThe new government is currently only recognized by Franco-Iberia and its associates, and with the speed of negotiations between the two parties, the mainland European state is expected to assert considerable influence over English foreign policy, the two having already signed a defensive agreement.

Though the Scottish and German lackeys may have been sent back to their masters, England is battered and bleeding, and we still have the matter of the Franco-Iberians to contend with. They are no doubt grateful for our victory, but they will surely be expecting very close cooperation with us.

  england_event.13.d: "Nigel’s presence at these war cabinet meetings had always been more of a formality recently. Every day, he simply checked in, bid his cronies a stiff salute, and went to check on the frontline map. He’d make his strategic interests known, and be off for tea not long after. In the war’s early days, not a corporal could cough without Mr. Hall’s approval, and he had frequently been persuaded away from being flown down to the field to see the developments firsthand. Now, however, the war was a sure thing. A meaningless game - his participation only as a symbol of respect to his fellow commanders. Would be awfully rude to simply jog on once things were looking good, after all.\n\n"Marshal John-Hall, sir." His personal aide rushed through the set of open doors. The boy was fortunate to keep his job - any heartless un-English blaggard would have replaced him with a drone decades ago.\n\n"Ah?" Nigel bleated out, craning his head up from the map. He cast a glare at the young man once he noticed the sheepish smile on his face.\n\n"We did it, sir." Nigel was just about to reprimand the young man for his vagueness when he continued. "All their remaining garrisons have been given the order to stand down, sir."\n\nA raucous cheer echoed through the war room. Men raised their fists, bumped their chests, and two old comrades even shared a rowdy headbutt. Yet in the middle of the room, arms still spread over his map…Nigel was almost motionless. His gaze was fixed into the little lights on his map board. Troop positions. Artillery. Air forces. And it all suddenly felt…\n\n…He wasn’t sure how to describe it. He didn’t like the feeling, and scrambled for something to explain it away. To make him want to cheer as the others were. It was then that it struck him. He hadn’t thought this far ahead. Did he even expect to get here? Surely.\n\nHe looked up to see his cronies, their cheers silenced and their postures stiffened, surely cowed by his own hesitance to celebrate. It did him good, he surmised. For them to know he wasn’t all pumped fists and rowdy yells. Yet as he dismissed them with his signature wave of the wrist, his gaze fell back to his map. To England, and the worries of running a nation rather than an army."

Ruddy stupid name." Someone had needed to explain to him how Franco-Iberia wasn’t just the French. It had promptly summoned questions about what on earth Iberia had to do with it, which had then launched into a discussion on modern European history, which Nigel had ended about a tenth of the way into.\n\n"Yes? And?" He was only really understanding half of anything his foreign secretary had said - the rural Welsh accent was not a tune Nigel understood very clearly. "And what obligations did we agree to?" He stopped in the lounge, sat on the arm of his armchair. His eyes glazed over to an old picture. Himself and James, his dear departed husband. He wondered if he’d be proud.\n\nHis mental wandering caused him to miss half of what was being droned into his ear. "Yes- yes! We’ll just-...what- what is a holo-call!? I’ll be damned if I’m being holo-ified on anything!"\n\nAnother pause. He understood that he and these ‘France-Iberians’ didn’t see eye to eye on matters of technological impurity, but a ‘holo-call’? What even was that? He’d seen holo-grams before, on great billboards paid for by ‘North Sea Alliance investment’, or as he liked to call it, Scotfund. But this was- "Fine!" It croaked out in a blurt of exasperation. "I’ll take a video call if I have to! Yes! Thank you- goodbye!" He angrily wrangled with the touchscreen on his phone for a moment before giving up and just turning the damned thing off, sinking back into his armchair."

Now, however, many of our men are wishing she’d been put down at the first opportunity.\n\nMs. Kenney was initially provided with a decent cell in a Leeds prison, but following several un-heeded warnings and reprimands, she has been relocated to a P.O.W camp in Oxfordshire, where she continues to rant and rave at any EF authority figure she can get her hands on. Even after several rounds of beatings and solitary confinement, her creative vocabulary and virile anger remained undeterred, often cursing out high ranking figures in the English Front, and most of the time, Nigel John-Hall himself despite the two not having met since the war began.\n\nNow that more pressing matters have been settled, the question remains of what to do with Ms. Kenney. Her opposition, though in similar hatred of the old government to ours, is sorely misguided and puppeted by German overlords, and her unpredictable nature makes her an awkward question at best."
  england_event_option.15.a: "Her unpredictability is far too dangerous to be tolerated, no matter where we put her. She’ll face a show trial for treason, and a firing squad."

  england_event.16.t: "The Blameful"
  england_event.16.d: "The old government was a weak and ineffectual system. For decades, England slid backwards into obscurity, poverty and despair because of their inaction. Their corruption, and their selling out to foreign power. Their desperate outreach to the NSA was the last straw for many - what few jobs remained in the nation were outsourced to Scottish businesses or made obsolete by vile new equipment with no care for the good English workers that they sent into slums and onto the streets.\n\nNow, that government is no more, and the idol of its failure, Barbara Taylor, languishes in a prison cell. Guards report of her unusually silent and sedentary demeanour, only following orders given and saying next to nothing to those around her. Even when our guards would try to pry a response out of her and in the event of beatings, she seemed unchanged. Now, the time has come to make a decision on her fate. A figurehead of nearly a century of failure, the people are watching closely."

  england_event.18.d: ""You’d sell us out straight to Hughes with those standards!" General Jade Bowley’s thick, gruff voice was distinct over the rest of the cabinet of army officials, influential sympathizers and other men of the inner circle. "People need that equipment to survive! You’d have them fight cancer with thoughts and prayers!" The uptight, clean but consistently malicious tone of Harker Evans, Millionaire Entrepreneur turned Minister for Employment, struck back with pinpoint precision. Even before the civil war, discussions on the intensity of technological persecution were a smouldering ember waiting to catch alight. To some, it was simply a matter of moderation. To keep the advances of the modern day in check and preserve the current values and practices. To others, it seemed more like a cult where any form of technology that didn’t date back to the 21st Century was inexcusably and uncompromisingly evil under all circumstances.\n\nIn the back, Nigel John-Hall, as always, sitting on his chair as the discussion fell to heated bawling. It was good for them to get their frustrations out in front of him. Like an unknowingly dose of alcohol, the tension loosened their tongues and showed their real values. He took notes in his head as he watched them, head resting on his joined hands, eyes cast up at them. What subjects drove each of them to raise their voices higher. Where they stuttered as they caught themselves before saying something they would have regretted. It taught him what each of them really wanted from throwing their lot in with the Front. How far they were willing to go.\n\n"Gentlemen." It was all Nigel had to say, and the discourse ended immediately. No man in the room was willing to contest with their leader, no matter their fervour. It was a perfect balance of loyalty and ignorant transparency. Just how he wanted it."

  england_event.23.d: "A sharp turn of events in England as the militia uprising led by Spring Party leader Cassie Kenney secures victory in the English Civil War.\n\nFounded in reaction to the sharp decline of the English economy and standard of life, much like some of its rivals in the recent conflict, the Spring Party is a party mostly holding support of the young and students, which calls for radical changes in English industry and a realignment towards environmental values akin to those followed by INTEGR and the German Federation. Already, the new state has formally opened its doors to German diplomats and declared support for them, and it is expected that German military support will soon bolster the nation against any attempt at reclamation by the North Sea Alliance.\n\nRadically environmentalist by modern standards, the Spring Party seeks to restart the ‘English Spring’, a plan devised in the mid-21st century to completely shift English industry and dependence on harmful fuels and practices. This plan was cancelled in the wake of the Great Mistake, but even for 21st century standards, it is remembered as incredibly environmentally progressive - something its namesake party takes pride in."

Though a new, more stable government for England has arrived, it is without a doubt thanks to the efforts of our allies in INTEGR; specifically, the Germans. The militaristic wing of the English Spring Party began as simply a ragged group of militia, and it is their efforts that prop us up. We will surely be expected to repay our debts, and we can do so, but it is of utmost importance that we maintain German confidence in our leadership. If they suspect us of being uncooperative or unreliable, we may find someone swiftly replacing Ms. Kenney, and our sovereignty will be undoubtedly compromised as a result."

  england_event.25.t: "A Moment of Joy"
  england_event.25.d: ""Ms. Kenney?" A knock came at the front door. A woman of voice and noise, Cassie was not expected to participate in the war room. Nonetheless, there was no answer. "Ms. Kenney, are you in here?" He turned the handle and stepped in…only to find Cassandra Kenney sitting on her knees in the living room, eyes glued to the television. A live coverage of the last holdouts in England. She was still in her pyjamas and had a bowl of ready-made noodles beside her.\n\n"Ms. Kenney."\n\n"I know- I know!" She suddenly stood up with a startling aura of excitement, knocking over her noodles and not even realising it as she ran over to the army officer. "We did it! I mean- we…we’ve almost done it, we’re just a little bit away and then we’ll-"\n\n"-Ms. Kenney! Please. That’s…why I’m here." Cassandra’s eyes squinted in a sudden suspicion, her happy tone dropping like a bag of cement, and she seemed ready to tear the man apart simply at the fact she didn’t understand. "...We have received the enemy’s unconditional surrender, Ma’am."\n\nSuddenly, her tone was not only joyous again, but she looked like she would explode. "Oh- Yes! Yes, amazing!" She yelled out in shrill squeals, hopping up and down on the spot. "Oh- okay, wait here! I need to make a speech, I…I got a bunch of notes ready, just- wait here!"\n\n"Ma’am, I-" And she was gone, darting up the stairs to get changed. The officer was left with the sound of her scrambling to gather her things, and the sight of her robotic vacuum cleaner sucking up a pile of spilled noodles."

  england_event.26.t: "A Board Meeting"
  england_event.26.d: "Once the initial stabilisation was out of the way, there came the matter of organisation, planning, and simply put; the future. German aid had helped win the English struggle, but as a new member of INTEGR, there were certain expectations to be met, agreements to be made, and a general understanding to be established.\n\nAll of this was just fine to Ms. Kenney. She understood that good manners and diplomacy played an important role in all this, even if her contemporaries thought her ‘ambitious’ and ‘over-idealist’. They just didn’t understand what was really at stake here. The Germans would, though, she was certain. England had been left behind the rest of Europe, so she couldn’t expect her fellows to understand the full extent of what was necessary. She was beaming with a pleasant, excited aura as her and her upper staff made pleasantries with their German counterparts.\n\nAnd then she sat down. Her knee jostled with excitement as the mundane agreements were made; everything that had been agreed on prior and needed to be done. She was hardly listening to their translator, it was all just the usual business. When the mundane was over, however, the phrase she had been waiting for came up.\n\n"Do you have any questions?"\n\nAnd she was off. She was spurting out her plans like a child who had an extra-special day at school, often losing herself in uncoordinated, disconnected ramblings. "-When we lower the sea levels-" and "-a wind turbine for every house-" were just a few of the things that left her mouth as she took up the air for several agonising minutes.\n\nBut then the retorts came.\n\n"We’ll have to see." "We’re not sure we can, Ms. Kenney." "That’s simply not possible."\n\nBy the end of it, she was grasping at straws - her favourite ideas had been thoroughly dropped and burned, and a sinking feeling was setting in. The idea that even the Germans weren’t as invested in her ideas. That they weren’t going to go as far as she knew they had to.\n\nHer smile was gone, and she found herself glaring daggers at her translator as if he were responsible for every blight and plague that ever was. Once the meeting was over, she found herself sitting in the car park, eyes burning holes into the rim of her steering wheel. Surely she could convince them? She just had to show them the benefits of her ideas. Show them that they could work. Then they would understand."

  england_event.27.d: "In a drawer on the desk of the Prime Minister, there was a folder labelled ‘To-Do’. Typically, no matter who it was, a folder with such a mundane name would be nothing more than a short list of tasks; a reminder of what needed doing before the day’s end. This folder, however, was a ‘To-Do’ list for the entirety of the nation. Plans for ‘rebuilding’. Revitalising England and restoring what was lost.\n\nThe first of these was named ‘The Welsh Rainforests’. Before the Great Mistake, western Wales hosted a small patch of lush, dense rainforest in her rich mountain valleys. It was nothing compared to the Amazon of old, but nonetheless, it was one of the most biodiverse places in the Isles. Now, however, it was all but lost. Forests remained, but they were not nearly as green and dense as they once were. The diverse species that had once inhabited it were significantly diminished.\n\nAnd Cassie intended to bring it all back.\n\nOf course, in her typical organisational fashion, her plans did not lay out any specific method, and her documents were mostly filled with motivation and drama about the benefits of such a plan. What little methods she intended to use were simply notes written onto the side of the sheet with phrases like ‘Plant extinct trees’ and ‘Bring back old species’. But nonetheless, it must be done. To prove to the world it could be."

Four times, they had attempted to call the vote, only for her targeted accusations and hurling of insults to delay their efforts. Only now, when the room was locked and her fury was devolved into muffled, high pitched noises and thuds against the door, did they finally raise their hands.\n\nA unanimous decision. Perhaps it wouldn’t have been, had the Prime Minister’s own display of immaturity not swayed the decision, but nonetheless, it was done.\n\nTime and time again, the ideals of the English Spring had pushed the boundaries of reason and tolerance. Time and time again did those among Cassie Kenney’s administration share confused glances and irritated remarks of dismissal, only to face a whiplash tone of aggression and defiance as if she were talking to the bowels of hell itself, and not her own staff.\n\nNobody spared a farewell to Cassie as she was escorted out of the building, even when her rage had calmed, settling into a resigned depression. None of the once smiling faces that had followed her to victory spared her anything more than a glance. A relief, even.\n\nShe did not lose her temper when she was left outside the front doors of the New Parliament building, nor did she plot her revenge against any ‘traitor to the planet’. She simply returned to her car, sat in the driver’s seat, and wept."

Expected to quickly suffer a crushing defeat due to their isolated position, lack of external support and small armed forces, the dark horse has turned the tide in a fashion none thought possible.\n\nEngland’s oldest political party to still exist, the Liberal Democrats found much of their recent support base in the same method as the rest as popular opinion of the New Labour Party plummeted, and the English standard of life with it. Its leader, MP, now Prime Minister Arthur Burr, is a charismatic, eccentric figure, espousing a long history of slight and betrayal by the other beliefs that he vehemently opposes. In fact, Burr’s dislike of his ideological opponents extends not only across England, but the world as a whole. Desiring for a return of 21st century pre-Great Mistake methods of government, guarantees of individual rights and a more moderate ideology, Arthur Burr’s stance to the world around him has earned the new nation few allies.\n\nIt seems the consequences of this are quicker to be realised than expected, as a Scottish denunciation of the new government followed shortly after their victory, and many observers expect an NSA intervention to be imminent."
