  election_season_kaz_desc:0 "It is that time of the year again, and the entire Federation is bustling with excitement. The 7th election of the Federation is upon us, and the government is up for grabs. The City-Village Party, despite a strong year in government, has tough opposition. The Cohesion Patriotic Front, a conglomerate of Supremacist, Voracist, and Masterist groups, has rallied following its defeat in Parliament twelve years ago. The Harmonist Steppe Alliance, ever the protectors of Central Asia's natural heritage, hope to replicate their success in the Northern provinces by gaining majority seats. The Islamist Divinists, holding strong in the Southern regions, are gathering much traction, so the election will definitely be close.\n\nSteppe Alliance Popularity is §H[GETharmony_kaz_value]§!\nIslamist Popularity is §H[GETdivinity_kaz_value]§!\nCohesion Popularity is §H[GETsupremacy_kaz_value]§!\nCity-Village Popularity is §H[GETundecided_kaz_value]§!"

#Events
 centralasia_event.1.t: "The Federation's Goal"
 centralasia_event.1.d: "The Central Asian Federation has three pillars of value: Liberty, Authority, and Equality. Ever since its foundation, the Federation has been a beacon of democracy in Asia, counteracting the powers of Eurasia and China. Although there have been hiccups in the past, such as the snap election of 2168 that almost saw a military takeover of government, freedom has prevailed.\n\nTo celebrate the Federation's independence and history, a large festival is being organized. Known as the "Sun Celebration", this festival will echo throughout all cities of Central Asia and showcase our heritage. As always, the competing parties have filed for their own displays at the Sun Celebration, hoping to piggyback on this momentous occasion to attract more members. The Sun Celebration has, so far, always been a non-partisan movement."
 centralasia_event_option.1.a: "The Cohesionists will present the new VR technology."
 centralasia_event_option.1.b: "Let the Alliance showcase its steppe restoration module."
 centralasia_event_option.1.c: "Allow the Islamists to reenact during the festival."
 centralasia_event_option.1.d: "Deny all requests! The Sun Celebration will remain neutral."

 centralasia_event.2.t: "The Federation's Heart"
 centralasia_event.2.d: "The Federation maintains an extensive network of surveys and employs thousands of statisticians. This way, we can quickly identify demographic trends in our society. The current outlook is worrisome, to say the least. Many citizens report that they do not wish to vote in the next election. This may be for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n-Dissatisfaction with the election process\n-Safety concerns\n-Lack of time\n-Lack of knowledge/interest in politics.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the parties have proposed their own, unique ways to promote voting. While either method will no doubt be effective to some degree, the parties will not hesitate to use this power against their opponents."
 centralasia_event_option.2.a: "Cohesion Patriots' network nodes increase participation."
 centralasia_event_option.2.b: "Steppe Alliance runs a digital information campaign."
 centralasia_event_option.2.c: "Divinits call upon all believers to vote."
 centralasia_event_option.2.d: "The current government can solve this issue. Just give it time."

 centralasia_event.3.t: "The Federation's Means"
 centralasia_event.3.d: "Central Asia is quite large. So large, in fact, that villages in the North and Center regions lack the means by which to vote. Travel to the cities is quite resource-intensive, and the only piece of modern hardware in those settlements is a public network node.\n\nAs always, the parties have their own solutions to this issue.\n-The Cohesionists are ready to open up party coffers to upgrade rural networks. By increasing network bandwidth, traffic on voting day should be less intense and capable of hosting more votes.\n-Meanwhile, the Harmonists believe in an old-fashioned approach. Through expansion of physical infrastructure, more voting facilities can be opened, or schools used to host the election. The City-Village party also supports this measure.\n-The Islamists also have a plan: They are open to the possibility of opening voting stations nearby local mosques."
 centralasia_event_option.3.a: "The Supremacists expand network node computers."
 centralasia_event_option.3.b: "The Alliance wins out."
 centralasia_event_option.3.c: "The pious can help in the construction of voting facilities."

 centralasia_event.4.t: "The Federation's Belief"
 centralasia_event.4.d: "Although most of the Federation's media outlets are nominally non-partisan, few truly believe so. State media supports the ruling party, the Village-City Coalition. The Supremacists have a firm grasp on network node media distribution, the Divinists utilize religious leaders to preach, while the Harmonists have thus far relied upon many private outlets.\n\nIt has come to the government's attention that, in recent months, the Harmonists have been attempting to expand their coverage. Party resources have been spent on propping up newspapers, funding online stations, and even some small-time freelancers. This threatens to upset the delicate balance between the parties."
 centralasia_event_option.4.a: "The government counterfunds news stations."
 centralasia_event_option.4.b: "The Harmonists maintain their grasp on new outlets."
 centralasia_event_option.4.c: "City-Village Party officials manipulate the media to their side."

 centralasia_event.5.t: "The Federation's Muscle"
 centralasia_event.5.d: "As election day nears, reports of political violence are flooding local governments. By all accounts, there is insufficient manpower to deal with rural militias and inter-city extremists, who have set up nearby voting stations. Police forces cannot act, either due to a lack of strength or because the thugs have not yet made their move.\n\nThe Cohesionists have proposed a new, Federation-wide police force responsible for election monitoring, made up of loyal and non-partisan elements. The Steppe Alliance and Islamists have been quick to support this arrangement, but the current government thinks otherwise. The parties can utilize their extensive contacts within the army and peacekeeper organizations to intimidate voters in their favor."
 centralasia_event_option.5.a: "Let the parties enforce peace."
 centralasia_event_option.5.b: "This is completely unnecessary."

 centralasia_event.6.t: "Budget Review"
 centralasia_event.6.d: "As the election nears, the City-Village Party must consider the prospect of this being its last term in office for a while. Nurlan Ayanev has drafted an advisory budget proposal for whoever may take the next seat, so as to keep the Federation's economy cohesive throughout the next term. However, there is still some time within which the City-Village Party can try and force through its more radical reforms.\n\nThese bills call for a social welfare expansion in the Uzbek-dominated rural areas, more relief aid to the Northern and Afghan regions, while also prioritizing the role of business in supporting the people. The other parties have thus far tried to shoot down these bills, fearful that, if passed, the relief aid would greatly increase the City-Village Party's standing. Still, there is room for minor reforms before the elections."
 centralasia_event_option.6.a: "Let's give it a try."
 centralasia_event_option.6.b: "The City-Village Party will not risk a controversy with these bills. Ignore them!"

 centralasia_event.7.t: "Northern Garrison Report"
 centralasia_event.7.d: "Scouts and spies in the Urals report a general mobilization among its warlords. Although we have beaten the Russians once before, and it is doubtful that the ragtag bandits of the mountains could pose any real threat to the Federation, we should nonetheless treat all threats as serious.\n\nSome generals have called for reinforcements to Omsk and other Northern towns. Conscription has always been unpopular in the Federation, and without a great looming threat to scare the people, our field armies are understaffed. The current government can provide some extra muscle to the Northern regions but risks its own popularity in the face of the election."
 centralasia_event_option.7.a: "Enact minor conscription in core cities."
 centralasia_event_option.7.b: "Tell high command they can handle it on their own."

 centralasia_event.8.t: "Construction Fundings"
 centralasia_event.8.d: "The city of Almaty, the second heart of the Federation, is prone to earthquakes. Indeed, throughout the city's long history, it has been nearly destroyed by Mother Nature on multiple occasions. While modern construction techniques have gone a long way, many of them are still in theory, while engineers and architects lack the funding to complete their bigger projects.\n\nThe architect Nurlan Aidosev, creator of the Omsk Redoubt, has proposed a resource-intensive plan for reinforcing Almaty's foundation with durable steel and creating platform foundations in certain neighborhoods. The plan is quite costly."
 centralasia_event_option.8.a: "Spare no expense for the people!"
 centralasia_event_option.8.b: "We'll deal with this later."

 centralasia_event.9.t: "Watch The East"
 centralasia_event.9.d: "The Chinese Dragon is ill. The People's Republic is showing its cracks and will fall apart into war any moment now. Popular discontent with their government is at an all-time high, periphery provinces are virtually independent states, and migrants flood through the exposed Siberian border by the hundreds of thousands. Once China tears itself apart, we can expect a massive refugee wave swarming over the Taklamakan Desert and into our country. Walls are already under construction, but more effort is required. The current government has contracted international corporations to help build defensive positions throughout Eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan."
 centralasia_event_option.9.a: "Give the builders more funding."
 centralasia_event_option.9.b: "A wall should be enough."

 centralasia_event.10.t: "The Elections of 2200"
 centralasia_event.10.d: "The votes are in and the elections are over. Across the Federation, millions stare at telescreens in anticipation of the results. The parties have given their all to secure a majority in Parliament, but the current government has also run a successful media campaign. This election will surely determine the future of the country for the next 6 years."
 centralasia_event_option.10.a: "And the winner is…"

 centralasia_event.11.t: "City-Village Holds On!"
 centralasia_event.11.d: "The City-Village Party has successfully defended the hill! Former Prime Minister Nurlan Ayanev has congratulated the new leader of Central Asia, Turlan Diasov. In a moving speech addressed to the whole nation, the new Prime Minister Diasov has pledged to honor the party line, redouble rural relief efforts, help mend the socio-economic gaps that plague the nation, and finish resettling displaced Uzbeks. Foreign organizations, including Alchemax Corporation and University of Eurasia have congratulated the new government and wish the nation luck for the next 6 years.\n\nThe other parties have gambled and lost. While their supporter base will never abandon the cause, common populations throughout the Eastern regions are expected to flip to City-Village and remain loyal for the term's duration. This puts the government in the unique position of having near total control over the country, allowing Diasov to shape Central Asia to his ideals."
 centralasia_event_option.11.a: "To another 6 years!"

 centralasia_event.12.t: "Harmonists Take Over!"
 centralasia_event.12.d: "The Steppe Alliance, having last held Parliament majority in 2182, is back in power. Espousing classical Harmonist values such as care for the dying Earth and genetic engineering, the Alliance's victory was not unexpected. Former Prime Minister Nurlan Ayanev has congratulated his replacement, Kamol Husanov, in a public press conference, wishing the new government and Federation luck. Foreign organizations such as the University of Eurasia and INTEGR have also sent congratulation letters to Husanov and will be sending over representatives within the month. The Steppe Alliance promises many things, but only time will tell if the reforms will come to pass. Husanov has announced a radical agriculture overhaul, the complete switch to the Ilianov-Hans Field Reinvigoration Parameter, and proposed limited price controls to curtail consumerism."
 centralasia_event_option.12.a: "We will rebuild the steppes!"

 centralasia_event.13.t: "Islamists Triumph!"
 centralasia_event.13.d: "The Islamic Preservation Party has always been a wildcard. Its support base consists of a wide variety of characters, ranging from isolated farmers to city-dwelling billionaires. The uniting force is Islam, the ancient religion that has survived many Mistakes. Having never held a majority in Parliament since the Federation's inception some fifty years prior, the Islamists promise to restore a spiritual balance in Central Asia, reunite displaced peoples, and enact many reforms to help the downtrodden.\n\nHalima Taraseva, new Prime Minister of Central Asia, has announced her support for all religious groups in and outside Central Asia and confirmed that the new ruling party will not overturn the Federation's secular government structure. Taraseva has also voiced support for the peoples of Iran and Afghanistan, who have suffered from civil war for generations. The other parties and Nurlan Aynev have congratulated the Islamists, but are projected to challenge some of the new government's more controversial policies throughout the term."
 centralasia_event_option.13.a: "Praise Allah!"

 centralasia_event.14.t: "Return of the Cohesionists"
 centralasia_event.14.d: "The impossible has been made possible, but only now that the elections are over have analysts spotted the signs. The Cohesion Patriotic Front of Central Asia, last in total power during the 2170's, has a smeared reputation. It was under Prime Minister Nazareva that General Garriov's coup nearly succeeded. Many still associate the golden Supremacist icon with the dark age of the Federation's democracy, but the Front has made significant progress in rebranding itself over the decades.\n\nNo longer a temperate coalition of dissenting scientists and technocrats, the Front has transformed into a party as cold and hard as the iron its members augment themselves with. The Cohesionists call for a united Central Asia, further developed by international corporations and reinforced by a strong government. Bans on augmentations and human morality laws are expected to be repealed within the month, but the other parties will not relent in dissent."
 centralasia_event_option.14.a: "We have a long road ahead of us."

#Ideas
  KAZ_apple_asia:0 "Apple of Asia"
  KAZ_apple_asia_desc:0 "The Central Asian Federation is one of the few countries fortunate enough to have evaded most of the Great Mistake. Its landlocked location, vast mountainous borders, and surplus of natural resources virtually guaranteed an age of prosperity as the elites of the world flocked to the Steppe. Despite war and political strife, the Federation stands tall."
  KAZ_great_bretayal:0 "Legacy of the Great Betrayal"
  KAZ_great_bretayal_desc:0 "The people of Central Asia have had a divisive history with their Northern friends. The Russians have both developed our cities, brought in arts and science, but also exploited our pastures and mines. However, no historian could have predicted the Great Betrayal, when the Eurasian Union State invaded our Federation. Through bravery and a little luck, we withstood the tide. Since then, our people yearn for a more peaceful age and will be difficult to mobilize."
  KAZ_baikonur_cosmodrome:0 "Baukonur Cosmodrome"
  KAZ_baikonur_cosmodrome_desc:0 "The Federation has been fortunate enough to inherit a large fraction of old Russia's space program in the wake of the Great Mistake. When St. Petersburg cried its last goodbye and Siberia collapsed into anarchy, a large core of scientists sought refuge in old Kazakhstan. The Baikonur Cosmodrome, where their students study and create satellites, is one of the few functioning planetary space yards left on Earth."
