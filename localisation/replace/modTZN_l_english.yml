  TZN_children_of_africa:0 "Children Of Africa"
  TZN_children_of_africa_desc:0 "The East African Federation is the direct successor state to the old African Union, which fell apart during the Congo Crisis of 2134. Although rife with nativist sentiments, anti-unification thought, and other backwards belief that would leave Africa in the dust, the Federation still clings to the hope of one day unifying the continent.\n\nIndeed, with each passing day, that possibility shifts into the realm of inevitability. The EAF wields the largest industrial base on the continent, the second largest land force in the world, and a rapidly modernizing society. The Pan-African Dream has not died, but flourished."
  TZN_abtbia:0 "ABTBIA"
  TZN_abtbia_desc:0 "The ABTBIA, or the African Board for Trade, Business, and other Internal Affairs, is the government body responsible for managing the economy. It has 50 seats, 40 of which are elected on a regional level and 10 of which are appointed by the President. However, there have been talks (mainly spearheaded by urban elites) for expanding the ABTBIA to 75 seats, as a way of better representing the Federation's diverse population.\n\nThe Board carries out regulation for public companies, sets financial standards and provides counsel to Parliament on relevant matters. All other oversight boards are required to file reports to the ABTBIA and many have their directors appointed by a ABTBIA vote. Recently, the Board has taken a special interest in heavy industry and the Pan-African infrastructure sector."

 #Leaders
  TZN_jama_samatar:0 "Jama Samatar"
  TZN_jama_samatar_desc:0 "Avuncular, genial, affable, affecting an air of bonhomie, Jama Samatar wished to be addressed as Kubwa Mjomba - "great uncle" in Swahili - by those he both commanded and protected. Despite his seeming benevolence and absent-minded demeanor, he was nonetheless an efficient and effective administrator, an able diplomat, and ruthless (when necessary). Samatar was amused and likely pleased when detractors likened him to the traditional African village chieftains of the past, claiming him to be a throwback and out-of-step with the new world in the wake of the Great Mistake.\n\nRising from the poverty and violence of the inundated streets of Hargeisa, Samatar joined the African Union's resurgent military forces, eventually rising to the rank of Major. For three decades he served in a variety of increasingly important posts, military and civilian, rising steadily in both ability and influence. He was able to overcome lingering tribal tensions, dealing with the polyglot cultures of Africa with both reverence and common sense. Jama Samatar proved to be just as efficient against any perceived threat to the well-being and safety of those under his protection. In dealing with nascent warlords, religious fanatics, and local dictators, he either brought about an equitable peace, or bludgeoned them into submission. Although never known as a military genius, his troops were extremely loyal to their "great uncle" and fought with abandon for his approval. Samatar never lost a battle, although he took no credit for his victories and viewed them as lamentable necessities. Though not religious himself, he has been tolerant and accepting of others' religious traditions."

 #Focuses
  TZN_dive_into_the_ocean:0 "Dive Into The Ocean"
  TZN_dive_into_the_ocean_desc:0 "Earth’s oceans are in dire shape. Pollution, overfishing and a warming climate have left aquatic ecosystems in disarray, bringing ruination to the communities that once relied on them to survive. While we have seen some success in restoring the ecosystems of our oceanic territories, stepping them up will breathe new life into coastal economies and put fish back on the menu."
  TZN_circle_lake_nalubaale:0 "Circle Lake Nalubaale"
  TZN_circle_lake_nalubaale_desc:0 "With an ample supply of water and successful anti-pollution efforts, Lake Nalubaale - formerly Lake Victoria - has attracted a very large number of people settling in its vicinity. As the region grows increasingly populated, we will need to ensure that public transport infrastructure in the region to keep up with demand."
  TZN_addis_ababa_railhub:0 "Addis Ababa Railhub"
  TZN_addis_ababa_railhub_desc:0 "With old trains and tracks straining under the weight of more users than ever, Ethiopia’s rail network is in desperate need of an overhaul. We’ve offered to step in and resolve the situation, which the people of Ethiopia will no doubt be thankful for."
  TZN_tanzaniasudan_connection:0 "Tanzania-Sudan Connection"
  TZN_tanzaniasudan_connection_desc:0 "In order to establish closer ties with Sudan, we have proposed establishing an extensive rail network spanning Tanzania to Sudan. While the project will be largely funded by us, it will no doubt help build ties with the Sudanese while providing much-needed transportation infrastructure to the region."
  TZN_two_years_to_superpower:0 "Two Years To Superpower"
  TZN_two_years_to_superpower_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the United States, the sole superpower the world has known is the ailing People’s Republic of China, whose own influence has grown increasingly questionable in recent years. As our already-impressive position in East Africa develops and our influences expands across the continent and its surrounds, superpower status is ours for the taking. Setting a distinct goal of achieving it will give all Africans something to put their hopes in and rally around."
  TZN_the_bluest_sky:0 "The Bluest Sky"
  TZN_the_bluest_sky_desc:0 "With our industrial and knowledge base, we are at a distinct advantage over our our foes in the air. Let us make use of this advantage, investing in our aerospace industry and pilot training programs to secure our control of the skies."
  TZN_ilats_fury:0 "Ilat's Fury"
  TZN_ilats_fury_desc:0 "Fielding a remotely competitive air force is deceptively complex. The industrial capacity and knowledge base needed to produce and maintain aircraft is very extensive, especially with foreign imports no longer being as viable an option as it once was. Fortunately, we have assembled an impressive air force, though the older planes are long overdue for replacements."
  TZN_kampala_international_airport:0 "Kampala International Airport"
  TZN_kampala_international_airport_desc:0 "Kampala International Airport - formerly Entebbe International Airport - has long been the sole international airport in Uganda. While this hasn’t been a major issue with the collapse of international travel, the airport is still long overdue for an overhaul. Doing so would also present an opportunity to set aside a portion of the facility for military use."
  TZN_a_pity_you_cannot_see_from_here:0 "A Pity You Cannot See From Here"
  TZN_a_pity_you_cannot_see_from_here_desc:0 "Having aircraft is one thing. Knowing how to use them is quite another. As we roll out new aircraft, we can afford to redirect older models for training purposes, allowing us to prepare a new generation of pilots with hands-on experience."
  TZN_supersonic_aircraft:0 "Supersonic Aircraft"
  TZN_supersonic_aircraft_desc:0 "Aircraft capable of travelling faster than the speed of sound are capable of projecting our air power at tremendous distances, responding to threats swiftly and decisively. Developing a new line of these aircraft will ensure that our control of Africa’s skies remains uncontested."
  TZN_we_will_ground_them:0 "We Will Ground Them"
  TZN_we_will_ground_them_desc:0 "As we move to unify the continent in the hopes of turning our eyes further afield, we must be ready to face aerial threats fielded by our enemies. Whether it’s CAS aircraft harassing our troops or bombers targeting our cities, we must ensure that our interceptor aircraft are up to the task of maintaining air superiority."
  TZN_we_will_drive_them_into_the_ground:0 "We Will Drive Them Into The Ground"
  TZN_we_will_drive_them_into_the_ground_desc:0 "While we cannot neglect our interception capabilities, the most pressing threats and opponents we face in Africa are predominantly ground-based. Close air support aircraft must be our top priority in order to press our advantage in the air."
  TZN_reap_the_air:0 "Reap The Air"
  TZN_reap_the_air_desc:0 "As our industrial capacity grows, so too does our ability to field more aircraft. With air wings larger than before, enemy fighters will be overwhelmed by strength of numbers alone."
  TZN_cover_the_sky:0 "Cover The Sky"
  TZN_cover_the_sky_desc:0 "Our dominance of the air will extend to the ground as well. By expanding our air force with additional CAS aircraft, enemy ground forces will come to look to the skies with fear of death from above."
  TZN_total_annihilation:0 "Total Annihilation"
  TZN_total_annihilation_desc:0 "Besides smaller fighter craft, dedicated bombers serve to push our advantage in the skies by threatening the ground forces and emplacements of our enemies. With a renewed effort to build homegrown bombers, we will ensure that nothing on the ground can stand in our way."
  TZN_kigali_railhub:0 "Kigali Railhub"
  TZN_kigali_railhub_desc:0 "In order to improve civilian and military access to our borderlands, we plan to construct a new railway based out of a central hub in Kigali. Economic benefits aside, this measure may prove critical in moving troops around should our borders fall under attack."
  TZN_the_panafrican_line:0 "The Pan-African Line"
  TZN_the_panafrican_line_desc:0 "Whether it be providing affordable public transport to those without personal vehicles or moving vast amounts of freight in a post-fossil fuel world, our rail network is the backbone of our economy. We must prioritize extending the network all across Africa, and any investment on our end will quickly pay itself back."
  TZN_modernize_tanzania:0 "Modernize Tanzania"
  TZN_modernize_tanzania_desc:0 "While Tanzania has long been a part of the East African Federation, local politics and disasters has left it beginning to lag behind. Investing in its economy will help bring it back into line with the rest of the Federation."
  TZN_sustainable_growth:0 "Sustainable Growth"
  TZN_sustainable_growth_desc:0 "It goes without saying that Earth’s environment is in a very precarious state. Economic growth must be carefully managed to avoid further decline, unnecessary consumption must be discouraged to conserve resources, and industry firmly regulated to prevent repeating past mistakes."
  TZN_expand_the_abtbia:0 "Expand The ABTBIA"
  TZN_expand_the_abtbia_desc:0 "There have long been suggestions for the African Board for Trade, Business and other Internal Affairs to be expanded from 50 seats to 75 to better represent our increasingly diverse population. Between this and the growing administrative demands of our expanding Federation, it is clear that the time is right to add these additional seats to the Board."
  TZN_unshackle_the_hand:0 "Unshackle The Hand"
  TZN_unshackle_the_hand_desc:0 "We have done much to regulate and control industry, but we must be careful not to be too alienating. A careful re-examination of our regulatory framework will help us identify redundant regulations that can be safely discarded, as well as areas where we can streamline. Many still won’t be happy, but they will at least see we are open to compromise."
  TZN_northern_heavy_industry:0 "Northern Heavy Industry"
  TZN_northern_heavy_industry_desc:0 "With one of the largest populations in the world, our demands for consumer goods and other manufactured products is considerable. If we are to keep up with demand, we must ensure that our industrial capacity is up to the task. And with unemployment becoming a growing problem in the north of our territory, we can kill two metaphorical birds with one proverbial stone."
  TZN_southern_hydro_plants:0 "Southern Hydro Plants"
  TZN_southern_hydro_plants_desc:0 "In order to meet projected energy demands in a sustainable manner, we must expand our clean energy portfolio. We have identified several sites in our southern regions that will be suitable for hydroelectric dams."
  TZN_unrelenting_industry:0 "Unrelenting Industry"
  TZN_unrelenting_industry_desc:0 "While it would be foolish to ignore the plight of the environment, at the end of the day we must make sacrifices to pursue our goals. We need a stronger military to stave off our enemies, and we need a stronger economy to keep our people prosperous. Preserving the environment will still be a major concern, but it cannot take precedence over everything else."
  TZN_focus_on_the_mbt:0 "Focus On The MBT"
  TZN_focus_on_the_mbt_desc:0 "The Main Battle Tank has long been a versatile machine, and it remains the backbone of modern militaries. Improving our ability to manufacture and field them will be key to future victories."
  TZN_legitimize_ai_planning:0 "Legitimize AI Planning"
  TZN_legitimize_ai_planning_desc:0 "The use of artificial intelligence in planning is not new, but as AI grows increasingly sophisticated it requires increasingly less input from human operators. We are now able to use plans drafted with minimal human involvement, with the end results being highly efficient and rationalised. Obviously some human oversight will still be needed for approval, but the improvements to the planning process makes this well worth the cost."
  TZN_network_node_expansion:0 "Network Node Expansion"
  TZN_network_node_expansion_desc:0 "While the internet of old may be long gone, the advent of network nodes and their associated datalinks have come to replace it on a local level in many nations. But with so many still lacking access to the rich informational resources that the datalinks offer, we must invest in building new network nodes to cover a wider portion of the population."
  TZN_legitimize_recycling_tanks:0 "Legalize Recycling Tanks"
  TZN_legitimize_recycling_tanks_desc:0 "Our lands are littered with ancient tanks dating as far back as the 20th century, with many collecting dust as trophies, being repurposed into tractors, or falling into the hands of bandits. By making a concentrated effort to seize and overhaul these tanks, we can expand our armored divisions with simple yet serviceable tanks at a low cost."
  TZN_import_asian_mining_specialists:0 "Import Asian Mining Specialists"
  TZN_import_asian_mining_specialists_desc:0 "From the longstanding People’s Republic of China to the nascent Central Asian Federation, Asia has survived the Great Mistake in surprisingly intact shape. Its command of vast mineral reserves has certainly helped, making them a world leader in the mining industry. Hiring some advisors so that we can utilise their expertise would no doubt aid in our own industrial efforts."
  TZN_tie_eco_to_energy:0 "Tie Eco To Energy"
  TZN_tie_eco_to_energy_desc:0 "The world has suffered much from the uncontrolled use of dirty energy sources. Establishing new clean energy projects will help ensure that we remain energy-independent while minimising our electricity sector’s environmental footprint."
  TZN_set_new_goals:0 "Set New Goals"
  TZN_set_new_goals_desc:0 "So far, we have managed to handily meet most of our goals for development. But it is not enough to sit around congratulating ourselves; we must maintain the momentum, setting new objectives and redoubling efforts to catch up where we lag behind."
  TZN_orbital_academy_of_sciences:0 "Orbital Academy Of Sciences"
  TZN_orbital_academy_of_sciences_desc:0 "There’s no better way to champion our scientific prowess than by demonstrating our capabilities than by demonstrating our space capabilities. Establishing a scientific academy in orbit would attract some of the brightest scientific minds of the age, all while serving as an important testbed for space-based technologies."
  TZN_enforce_parcel_tracking:0 "Enforce Parcel Tracking"
  TZN_enforce_parcel_tracking_desc:0 "As developed as our industry is, a sizeable amount of transportation is handled through informal means, at times leading to the loss or theft of cargo. Enforcing the tracking of parcels will create additional accountability in the transportation sector, ensuring that goods arrive at businesses and factories safely."
  TZN_expand_the_workday:0 "Expand The Workday"
  TZN_expand_the_workday_desc:0 "With the demand for military materiel and consumer goods increasing, our factories are struggling to keep up. Some factory owners are proposing that the legal workday be extended, allowing workers to perform longer shifts. By requiring workers to volunteer for such shifts and be given additional breaks, we might be able to get them on board with the idea."
  TZN_develop_somalia:0 "Develop Somalia"
  TZN_develop_somalia_desc:0 "Despite weathering the Great Mistake, Somalia still finds itself falling behind its neighbors in terms of critical infrastructure. Establishing a development fund with a focus on revamping the nation’s rail network will be a good start in helping them catch up."
  TZN_bail_out_iniko_bank:0 "Bail Out Iniko Bank"
  TZN_bail_out_iniko_bank_desc:0 "Iniko Bank is the largest bank in Somalia at present. Unfortunately, instability in the region and government mismanagement (where there has been management at all) means that the bank may not even exist for much longer. Bailing out the bank would prevent economic disaster in Somalia, and buy us considerable influence within the bank’s leadership."
  TZN_locked_and_loaded:0 "Locked And Loaded"
  TZN_locked_and_loaded_desc:0 "As the 23rd century dawns, the East African Federation’s military stands as the second-largest in the world. While we have proven more than capable of subduing local warlords, sheer manpower alone will not be sufficient to unite the continent or fend off foreign invasion. We must modernize rapidly, and determine where our strategic priorities shall lie."
  TZN_we_have_the_skill:0 "We Have The Skill"
  TZN_we_have_the_skill_desc:0 "While we cannot neglect our defenses, our military is ultimately our most powerful tool for power projection. Focusing on military training will not only help us defend the Federation, but to intervene elsewhere on the continent and take the fight to our enemies as needed. Re-examining our training and equipment will ensure that our forces remain the best on the continent."
  TZN_tier_iv_training_sequence:0 "Tier IV Training Sequence"
  TZN_tier_iv_training_sequence_desc:0 "In order to remain competitive on a global scale, we must ensure that our infantry training is on par with the best. The Training Sequences system commonly used in Europe is widely recognized as the current best practice in infantry training. Ensuring that our basic troops receive Tier IV training (covering harsh weather, urban combat, rapid engagement and crowd control) will ensure that they are equipped to handle the challenges of 23rd century warfare."
  TZN_orbital_military_institute:0 "Orbital Military Institute"
  TZN_orbital_military_institute_desc:0 "The Orbital Military Institute was proposed decades ago, intended as a symbol of national pride in our military. It would take the form of a small but advanced space station, where our most elite commanders engage in highly advanced military simulations and coordinate with observation staff to monitor conflicts on the planet below. It will no doubt be an expensive project, but it would firmly cement our presence as one of the most advanced militaries in the world."
  TZN_lightspeed_warfare:0 "Lightspeed Warfare"
  TZN_lightspeed_warfare_desc:0 "Mobility has long been a deciding factor in modern warfare, and this has changed little since the Great Mistake. Investing in the latest fuel cell engines for our vehicles and refining mechanised warfare tactics for our infantry will allow us to strike where the enemy is weakest or cover gaps in our defenses as rapidly as possible."
  TZN_the_os_line:0 "The C-S Line"
  TZN_the_os_line_desc:0 "The Congo-South Africa Line has long been touted as a crucial piece of defensive infrastructure against Congolose and wider Kimpwanza League incursion. While some elements have been implemented piecemeal, finalising the Line would significantly bolster our defenses against our hostile neighbors."
  TZN_we_have_the_time:0 "We Have The Time"
  TZN_we_have_the_time_desc:0 "At the end of the day, our military exists to serve our people and our nation, and defending both must be of the highest priority. While this does not preclude us from taking the offensive, this should not come unless our civilians are safe and our soldiers stand the best possible chance of returning home."
  TZN_prepare_fortifications:0 "Prepare Fortifications"
  TZN_prepare_fortifications_desc:0 "The Federation is surrounded by hostiles, including the Kimpwanza League to the west, unstable nations to the north, and the odd surviving bandit warband squatting on the peripheries. Prioritising the construction of fortifications, airbases and other defensive emplacements will help us secure our borders."
  TZN_emergency_rotation:0 "Emergency Rotation"
  TZN_emergency_rotation_desc:0 "By activating reservist forces and assigning them to man our bunkers, we will ensure that our borders are well-defended against incursion. We can dedicate some manpower to building new fortifications, too."
  TZN_army_of_the_people:0 "Army Of The People"
  TZN_army_of_the_people_desc:0 "If our army serves the people, the people must also serve the army. Implementing a year of mandatory national service will help fill the gaps in less essential postings, while overhauling our reservist system will ensure that we have an even greater pool of manpower to call upon."
  TZN_an_undefeated_dream:0 "An Undefeated Dream"
  TZN_an_undefeated_dream_desc:0 "From the Great Mistake to the Congo Crisis and collapse of the African Union, the East African Federation still stands strong. We stand as an emerging world power, backed by expansive industry, a large army, and an impressive technological base. The dream of Pan-Africanism is alive and well within our borders, and it will soon spread far beyond."
  TZN_the_interparty_line:0 "The Interparty Line"
  TZN_the_interparty_line_desc:0 "While the Pan-African Parliament is made up of many political parties, most of the major ones are surprisingly united in their goal of achieving Pan-African nationhood. They may disagree on just what form that should take or where our priorities should lie in realising it, but maintaining that precious thread of unity will be vital to avoiding the infighting that has crippled so many other nations."
  TZN_acalan_expansion:0 "ACALAN Expansion"
  TZN_acalan_expansion_desc:0 "With more than 3000 different ethnic groups and 2000 languages on the continent, it is vital that we take steps to respect and understand them. This makes the African Cultural Academy of Languages, Art and Nationhood a vital organization, with its efforts to promote the education, recognition and use and African culture. Expanding its funding would allow it to continue its work, and even explore the emerging field of affordable AI-assisted translators."
  TZN_umoja:0 "Ujamaa"
  TZN_umoja_desc:0 "Ujamaa. Fraternity. It is with this cooperative ideal that the East African Federation has long governed itself. While the major parties subscribe to it in some capacity, there is no doubt that the Federation now stands at a crossroads of very different paths ahead. One way or another, a new future will be decided, whether it on the road to greatness or to ruin."
  TZN_the_road_of_plenty:0 "The Road Of Plenty"
  TZN_the_road_of_plenty_desc:0 "In a surprise victory, the Mbaba Mwana Waresa Foundation has won the election, with its vision of restored natural heritage resonating with voters. Moyo Chengetai now leads with an ambitious plan to restore Africa’s ecosystems to the benefit of its people, going beyond mere conservation to expansive rejuvenation. It is no small challenge, but one that Chengetai firmly believes the African people are up to meeting."
  TZN_machine_service:0 "Machine Service"
  TZN_machine_service_desc:0 "The technology now exists to automate vast amounts of labor tasks. But rather than rush in blindly and leave our citizens unemployed, let us use cutting edge machines to better our citizens’ lives. We can improve delivery of services to underserved areas or working to restore the environments they inhabit to their former glory."
  TZN_an_agrarian_life:0 "An Agrarian Life"
  TZN_an_agrarian_life_desc:0 "Environmental decline forced many farmers from the land, either selling it off to industrial agriculture corporations or simply leaving it unproductive. As we breathe new life into Africa’s land, rural communities can get a new lease on life as farming becomes a viable option once more."
  TZN_fly_to_the_stars:0 "Fly To The Stars"
  TZN_fly_to_the_stars_desc:0 "Just because we prioritise life on Earth doesn’t mean that space has nothing to offer us. Securing our footing in orbit will allow us to field many useful satellites, be they for monitoring the climate or facilitating communications. There may yet come a day that we can expand our horizons further, but we must make sure our home is stable before we can justify it."
  TZN_mold_nature:0 "Mold Nature"
  TZN_mold_nature_desc:0 "It is not enough to rejuvenate nature - we must help ensure that it can not only withstand human activity, but support it. Genetic modification and ecological engineering must walk hand-in-hand with rewilding and conservation, so that future generations may thrive alongside their environment."
  TZN_a_sea_of_green:0 "A Sea Of Green"
  TZN_a_sea_of_green_desc:0 "With each passing day, Africa’s scars heal. Where decades ago there was desertified farmland and slash-cut jungles, there are now verdant crops and nascent rainforests. We have built ourselves a second chance, and we must make sure that we do not squander nature’s gifts a second time."
  TZN_beneath_an_open_sky:0 "Beneath An Open Sky"
  TZN_beneath_an_open_sky_desc:0 "The world will likely never recover from the Great Mistake. But often in nature, it is from death that new life springs. And with the seeds we have sown, a new Africa will one day bloom, with future generations once more able to enjoy nature’s bounty. Hopefully, they will know well enough to avoid squandering it a second time."
  TZN_respect_maketh_man:0 "Respect Maketh Man"
  TZN_respect_maketh_man_desc:0 "The Samatar Barre and the People’s African Party remain in power, having won based on a campaign based on a single word: respect. For whether it be respect for each other, for our culture or for our planet, respect is what has made our nation what it is today. And as we move into this new era, the world will come to respect Africa like never before."
  TZN_infinite_prosperity:0 "Infinite Prosperity"
  TZN_infinite_prosperity_desc:0 "The world has enough for every man’s needs, just not every man’s greed. By promoting ascetic virtues and the rejection of materialism, we can help ensure that our people live comfortable and fulfilling lives without veering into unsustainable lifestyles."
  TZN_the_golden_continent:0 "The Golden Continent"
  TZN_the_golden_continent_desc:0 "Every era has had its shining city on the hill. Now, it is time for Africa to occupy that position. As our economy grows and our control of the continent expands, eyes are beginning to turn to us. And while the globalized economy may be no more, we can still expect to see enough of an influx of foreign investment and skilled migrants to bolster our position."
  TZN_an_honor_to_serve:0 "An Honor To Serve"
  TZN_an_honor_to_serve_desc:0 "Our military is the pride of our nation, and the envy of all Africa. Whether it be on the battlefield, at the site of natural disasters or even simply patrolling the streets, they are the protectors of our people. Elevating them to a position of cultural myth will no doubt attract many new recruits, who will serve with bravery and dedication."
  TZN_deep_memory:0 "Deep Memory"
  TZN_deep_memory_desc:0 "With so much cultural heritage lost during the Great Mistake and subsequent conflicts, it has never been more important to remember the past. But we must go further than that. The Deep Memory project is a an ambitious initiative to archive not only cultural works, but adjacent social contexts and related metacommentary. The end result is a vast library that allows interaction with cultural works within the full context of its cultural zeitgeist."
  TZN_till_the_earth:0 "Till The Earth"
  TZN_till_the_earth_desc:0 "Africa has been home to some of the heaviest population growth in recent centuries, even before the Great Mistake. Feeding the continent is no small challenge, especially if we are to do so in an environmentally sustainable and climate resilient manner. But with an educated population and no shortage of workers, we stand ready to overhaul our agricultural sector to meet the needs and challenges of this new century."
  TZN_eradicate_starvation:0 "Eradicate Starvation"

There will be no better way to assert Africa’s ascension on the global stage than constructing a multipurpose superstation in orbit, one that will surpass even the International Space Station of old. Of course, this will take many years to realize. But even embarking on the project will place us firmly at the head of a new space race."

  TZN_land_of_liberty_desc:0 "In a shock upset to the People’s African Party, the Continental Popular Front - the PAP’s most direct opponent - has won out. While this doesn’t spell the end of the Pan-African dream, it does represent a major ideological shift.

The People’s African Party’s plans for Africa would have seen this same practice continued across the continent. While we do agree that a united Africa is in our best interests, this cannot come at the cost of national identities. Pushing for greater recognition of national cultures will ensure that Africa remains a vibrant land, rather than a monotone one."
  TZN_merit_in_freedom:0 "Merit In Freedom"
  TZN_merit_in_freedom_desc:0 "While the EAF of old was by far from authoritarian, it was very overbearing in the laws and regulations imposed upon its people.

  TZN_follow_progress:0 "Follow Progress"

  TZN_pan_africanism:0 "Pan-Africanism"
  TZN_pan_africanism_desc:0 "Africa and its people have long stood divided, but this need not be the case forever.

  TZN_anti_nativism_desc:0 "While we respect the ethnic and cultural groups within the Federation, there are always those that will demand more recognition or refuse to let go of ancient animosities.

Not when it was what spelled the end of the African Union of old."

  TZN_assign_indian_priorities:0 "Assign Indian Priorities"
  TZN_assign_indian_priorities_desc:0 "India is situated comparatively close to us geographically, and is a deceptively emergent power on the world stage. Though many would have written it off after the Great Mistake, it has made remarkable progress towards reunifying and rebuilding. Establishing a diplomatic presence there will ensure that we are on at least comfortable terms with whoever comes out on top, securing a foothold in an economy rising from the ashes."

Despite our inroads through the Northern Advisor Office, the bulk of our involvement in the area is only just beginning."
  TZN_westbound:0 "Westbound"
  TZN_westbound_desc:0 "West Africa was hit the hardest by the collapse of the African Union, quickly becoming cut off from East Africa by the chaos. Now that the dust has settled, the situation is grim. The region is heavily divided, and many of its major powers hold ideals as dangerous as they are extreme. But that doesn’t mean all in the area are unreceptive to us."

  TZN_a_warpath:0 "A Warpath"
  TZN_a_warpath_desc:0 "There are some in West Africa who are strong enough to challenge us. Whether it be through advanced technology, relentless industrialism or sheer fanaticism, they have little to no intention of considering our offers.

  TZN_limited_recognition:0 "Limited Recognition"
  TZN_limited_recognition_desc:0 "While the advantages are extensive, it is understandable that nations would be hesitant to risk their identity and sovereignty by joining us.

  TZN_african_trade_union:0 "African Trade Union"
  TZN_african_trade_union_desc:0 "Trade is the lifeblood of nations. By establishing a trade union in West Africa, we can help the ailing region get back on its feet.

  TZN_abolish_household_registration_desc:0 "Loosely modelled on the Hukou system used in China, the Household Registration System was a half-baked attempt to discourage uncontrolled mass migrations that swept many parts of the world. While it did succeed to some extent, it is an increasingly redundant measure that routinely attracts criticism from the public. Abolishing it would be a welcome move, and free up funding more urgently needed elsewhere."

  TZN_address_intertribal_conflicts_desc:0 "Tribal conflicts have long hampered our efforts to unite the nations of the Federation, and will no doubt pose a major hurdle in uniting the continent. From ancient rivalries to modern tensions, addressing such conflicts while accounting for local cultures will be an exceptionally difficult task. But with the cost of failure being continued instability and violence, we can’t afford to ignore them."
  TZN_expand_regional_autonomism:0 "Expand Regional Autonomism"
  TZN_expand_regional_autonomism_desc:0 "Our most powerful tool for fighting nativism is to demonstrate our own commitment to the cultures and peoples of Africa. Granting additional autonomy to various regions would allow them to better preserve their cultural identity, while still remaining part of our wider Pan-African community. It would also help make this community an ever more vibrant place culturally, too."
  TZN_the_radicals:0 "The Radicals"
  TZN_the_radicals_desc:0 "Of course, not all within the major parties toe the same line. Some have visions of Africa that diverge considerably from the mainstream, from technocrats promoting cutting-edge technology in all aspects of daily life through to libertarians seeking to expand personal freedoms almost to the extent of the NMLAP. Paying lip service to the more palatable positions - and making a concentrated effort to alienate the less palatable ones - will help shore up our position politically."
  TZN_party_unity:0 "Party Unity"
  TZN_party_unity_desc:0 "While the internal affairs of other parties are ultimately their own, we have a little more sway over our own. The People’s African Party embodies the values of the EAF and its Pan-African ideals in many ways, but there are always opportunities to adjust our position to better do so."
  TZN_a_united_state:0 "A United State"
  TZN_a_united_state_desc:0 "While granting additional autonomy sounds good on paper, it risks emboldening the same nativist sentiments that we seek to contain. The Federation should instead focus on promoting a single, united polity wherein all peoples are recognized as part of a wider community. This will not only be easier to govern, but standardisation will further assist with industrial efforts."
  TZN_consider_dissidents:0 "Consider Dissidents"
  TZN_consider_dissidents_desc:0 "While the Pan-African dream flourishes within the EAF, not all are happy with the way the country is run. After the enactment of emergency powers during the Congo Crisis decades ago, our nation has not been as democratic as our rhetoric claims. Rather than continue to languish in this hypocrisy, it may be time to consider deactivating these emergency powers and restart the full democratic process."
  TZN_meritocratic_rule:0 "Meritocratic Rule"
  TZN_meritocratic_rule_desc:0 "Rather than continue to languish under emergency powers, the time has come for the Federation to begin reinstating democratic rule. But that doesn’t mean we should let just anyone run for office - rather than let rampant populism lead to a repeat of the Congo Crisis, we will enact stringent but fair requirements on people running for office. This will ensure that they are qualified enough to lead, while still keeping the system reasonably democratic."
  TZN_dominant_party_democracy:0 "Dominant Party Democracy"
  TZN_dominant_party_democracy_desc:0 "The emergency powers enacted after the Congo Crisis were put in place for a reason: to prevent rabid populism and nativism from undermining the state. While we have not turned our back on democracy, we cannot allow ourselves to be paralyzed by political deadlock. Retaining certain powers would ensure that we remain in firm control of the nation even after the election, though it’s very likely that other parties will use these same powers should they manage to defeat us at the polls."

  TZN_anti_capitalist_rhetoric:0 "Anti Capitalist Rhetoric"
  TZN_anti_capitalist_rhetoric_desc:0 "Capitalism is a dirty word to many in Africa. For a long time it was the driving force behind colonialism in our lands, and many argue it was a key factor in the climate breakdown that accompanied the Great Mistake. Acknowledging these ideas in our messaging will help bolster popular support."

  TZN_aid_for_the_mpla_desc:0 "The Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola - the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola - is an enduring political party, if nothing else. Founded nearly 250 years ago, it has long been a dominant political party in Angola even after the Great Mistake. But with the movement now in opposition to the ruling Congo-aligned nativists, we must ensure that they are well-funded… and armed."

  TZN_the_congolese_legacy_desc:0 "The Congo Crisis represents the worst of the nativist sentiments that infest Africa. With one nationalistic uprising in the Congo, the African Union of old was hurled into a death spiral from which it never recovered.

Consisting of various local warlords too entrenched to readily remove or too useful to oppose, it has served as a buffer between us and our belligerent neighbor for decades. But as the conditions in the Rift deteriorate with the warlords fighting among themselves and the NMLAP reaching out to them with overtures, the time has come to conclusively resolve the situation in the area."

  TZN_restart_the_proxy_war_desc:0 "Distasteful an option as it may seem, manipulating the Mwitanzige warlords to attack the Congo would severely damage damage the NMLAP’s credibility. We don’t expect the warlords to last long, though covertly sending them weapons and trainers may keep them in the fight a little longer. While arming warlords is still a very dubious move, it is still the lesser of two evils; the warlords’ crimes pale in comparison to the unmitigated chaos that the NMLAP would unleash upon the land if left to spread."
  TZN_expand_the_union:0 "Expand The Union"
  TZN_expand_the_union_desc:0 "The Mwitanzige Rift has been freed, with relief aid flooding to their long-suffering populations. There is no doubt that they will now be joining the EAF out of gratitude, and we must not be shy about highlighting the fact.

  TZN_aid_the_rebels_desc:0 "The rebellion in Nuer against the Waumalese government claims to be a just cause: one overthrowing a corrupt and tyrannical regime. While normally we would take this with a grain of salt, this situation is of interest for two main reasons. The first being that the rebels have stated a willingness to consider EAF membership in exchange for our help. The second is that Egypt - a major power in North Africa - is currently fighting Waumala-backed insurgents in Sudan proper. Aiding the rebels thus opens up inroads not only in Waumala, but possibly even further north."

Despite having long viewed us favorably, Somalia’s government has been deeply critical of both our support of anti-government rebels and our moves to placate Sudan and Egypt, both longtime regional rivals of Somalia. However, with public EAF support still widespread, we may be able to use the situation to our advantage. Perhaps even enough to convince the people of Somalia that we represent their interests better than their own government."

  TZN_aid_the_sudanese_revolution_desc:0 "Sudan and Egypt face an uprising by anti-Egypt insurgents, rebelling against Egypt’s dominance in Sudanese affairs. While these nationalists border dangerously close to the nativism we abhor, they have proven savvy enough to consider our aid. We have come to an informal agreement: we will support their fight against Egypt, and in exchange they will seriously consider integration under the provision that Sudan is provided with a greater level of autonomy than most nations. It is a steep price to pay, but worth it to avoid bloodshed. Enough will come of facing Egypt, anyway."
  TZN_european_cooperation:0 "European Cooperation"

  tzn.1.d:0 "Jama Samatar walked the streets of Dodoma, savoring the sensations of humanity.\n\nIt was near midday, and the lunchtime rush was on. In the shade of colorful tarps running between buildings, crowds of uniformed students, jumpsuited workers and people wearing garbs of a thousand different cultures jostled for space at food stalls and streetside eateries. The sharp aroma of spice was ever-present, mingling with the meats and vegetables sizzling in their pots. The noise was just as ubiquitous, with conversation serious and joyful filling the air.\n\nSamatar was technically in the city on business; another troop inspection with all the usual pomp and circumstance. But that was all done with. A couple of the troops had recommended a particular eatery not far from the barracks, and now walked with him as companions and an informal bodyguard detachment. They were talking of their experiences in training, mainly the mishaps. Mishandled weapons, incompetent recruits and exasperated sergeants brought no small amount of laughter between them, not least of all from Samatar himself. He had a few tales of his days in the army to share in return.\n\nOf course, he dared not share all his experience. His time in the army had left him memories that couldn’t be any further from humorous. War, famine and poverty still wracked much of his beloved Africa, and he had seen it all with his own wide eyes. Not a day went past without the fact paining him. Even his boundless pride in the East African Federation was mired by the knowledge of the conditions elsewhere on the continent.\n\nBut he refused to let himself give into despair. In a world where America had faded into obscurity, Europe remained ever divided and even the seemingly-implaccable China couldn’t agree on who’s in charge, the EAF stood resurgent. The peace around him, filled with joy and the prosperity, was its ultimate triumph. There would come a time when the rest of Africa would share in it. And, perhaps, they could help the world heal."

  tzn.2.t:0 "The Election Looms"
  tzn.2.d:0 "With the announcement of an imminent new election, the long-prepared parties of the Federation have sprung into action. Every wall from Kenya to Lesotho is plastered with posters for the various parties and candidates, with observers highlighting four in particular who are likely contenders for victory.\n\nThe People’s African Party represents a continuation of the status quo: Pan-Africanism with socialist leanings and an opposition to nativism. Its vision for Africa is one united politically, culturally and economically, standing protective of its citizens and sovereign in its international dealings. This vision - and indeed the party’s time in office - has proven very popular, albeit not without criticisms. There are plenty who would wish to take a new path, but perhaps even more uneager to rock the proverbial boat.\n\nRunning in direct opposition is the Continental Popular Front. It represents some truly major divergences from the PAP, albeit not as extremely as appearances may indicate. It is more supportive of nationalism, but still shuns outright nativism as counterproductive xenophobia. It espouses eased regulation on small businesses, but firmly supports corporate regulation and accountability. Perhaps most importantly, it opposes the PAP’s vision for a Pan-African nation, instead seeking to build a Pan-African coalition where every nation has a voice. While some may accuse them of having sympathies for the Kimpwanza League, they firmly reject such claims.\n\nThen there’s the Mbaba Mwana Waresa Foundation, named after a Zulu nature goddess, vying for the environmentalist vote. But while it does hold conservationist positions in many ways, the MMW Foundation is far more active in promoting outright ecological engineering as a means of revitalizing Africa’s ecosystems. A healthy environment, they reason, will fuel a stronger economy. With many farming communities wracked by desertification and fishermen catching more plastic than fish, their messages have found an ample audience.\n\nOf the major parties, the Baadaye Mkali Party is perhaps the most unorthodox. Its platform is the scientific and the technological, with both being integral to its vision of the bright future it has named itself after. Vast improvements to education systems and research industries are on the cards, with aims to supercharge the economy with advanced technologies in every sector. It is an ambitious vision, and not one that everyone finds convincing or desirable, but it has gathered its supporters nonetheless."

  tzn.3.d:0 "For all its flaws and the crises gripping the continent, the African Union survived the Great Mistake. As Europe grew divided and the United States fell into civil war, Africa pulled together to survive. Many of our Pan-African ideals can be traced back to the African Union, which increasingly grew to embody them as time went on.\n\nBut the African Union was not perfect. Internal problems plagued it even before the Great Mistake, which in many ways only made them worse. Corruption, division and a lack of resources hindered even the most successful efforts. But the breaking point came with the Congo Crisis of the 2150s. The Congo was wracked by a nationalist uprising against the ruling African Union loyalists, ultimately seizing the nation. As nationalist and nativist sentiments spread to surrounding nations, the African Union’s centers of power in East Africa were suddenly cut off from its forces in West Africa. As the political situation in the East collapsed, forces in the West either disbanded, defected or were overrun by local enemies.\n\nEven with the African Union now long having dissolved, the Congo Crisis still looms large over the East African Federation. An emboldened Congo sits just across our border, firmly opposed to our expanding influence. Their Kimpwanza - ‘Independence’ - League has only spread, with League-aligned leaders dominating Angola, South Africa, Ogowe and Adamawa. Meanwhile, West African power blocs and warlords grew empowered by former African Union defectors and equipment, allowing them to make major gains through force and intimidation. There is no doubt that the collapse of the African Union was a serious blow to the dream of Pan-Africanism, and one that we will not recover from for a long time."

These warlords have long stood as a buffer between the nativist Congo and the Pan-Africanist East African Federation, with the current fighting coming as a shock to many military analysts. While the Congo is expected to win the conflict, its failure to contain the warlords and protect its citizens has been criticized by many.\n\nHowever, the truth of the conflict may be more complicated. Reports on the ground indicate that the warlords are using equipment of EAF origin, leading to Congolese officials accusing the East African Federation of backing the conflict. The EAF has so far denied the allegations, but offered no explanation of how the warlords came to possess such modern weaponry."

However, President Barre’s Continental Popular Front stands by a very different vision of Pan-Africanism than most, forgoing the ousted People’s African Party’s unified African identity in favor of a looser union of largely independent states. The CPF has also overseen considerable expansion of individual rights and freedoms, often resulting in conflict with the PAP. These clashes have attracted considerable media attention for the fact that the PAP’s leader is Samatar Barre, Walaalkaa’s brother.

This isn’t a difficult issue in most major cities - digital voting using a heavily-verified portal is accessible to anyone with a connection to a network node, though the datalinks can get a bit sluggish on election day. Physical voting is still an option too, though with average temperatures of the 23rd century being what they are most people would prefer a mail-in ballot than lining up in the heat.\n\nBut head outside the cities, and it gets much more complicated. While regional network infrastructure has seen considerable expansion over the years, it often struggles to keep up with demand on voting day even without cyberattacks. And in some places, digital voting is still so limited it’s usually done in-person at designated sites. A local hall or school will become a hive of electronic activity for a day, with plenty of signs warning against tripping over the cables. But whether the polling stations allow physical or digital voting, there’s often an influx of people from remote farms and settlements to their nearest station, much to the excitement of local businesses.\n\nNow, whether it be in the bustling metropoli or the humble backwaters, the people are faced with a choice. With their home emerging as a distinct candidate for the status of superpower, their votes may well shape Africa for generations to come. Or, if the worst comes to pass and the world continues to buckle, the fighting chances that it will have in a world of chaos.

The Mbaba Mwana Waresa Foundation had spent more than a year trying to improve the water quality in the expanded Baía de Sofala, but they were well behind schedule. Turns out that the runoff from all those submerged towns and factories wasn’t good for the water, or the things that lived in it.\n\n‘Progress is progress,’ Samatar Barre said, looking over her shoulder. ‘Your work here is admirable. I’m sure you will refine it in good time.’\n\nChengetai snorted, though she at least gave the former president a grateful smile. ‘Time is one thing we don’t have. Enough people along this coastline go hungry. If we can’t get fish stocks to improve…’\n\nBarre patted her shoulder reassuringly. ‘You’ll find a solution. I’ve seen the effort you’ve put into this project, and I’ve seen your determination to help the folks in the area. Those are the marks of a good leader in my eyes.’\n\n‘Thank you, Kubwa Mjomba,’ Chengetai said. ‘It was an honor to run against you. I won’t squander your legacy.’\n\nBarre smiled, gesturing down the beach. The cleanups had done away with the worst of the garbage piles, but there was still plenty of trash washing up from the brackish waters. ‘We’ve already squandered our ancestors’ legacy. But I trust you to help breathe some new life back into it. Just remember not to lose track of the people in the process.’\n\n’I won’t, Kubwa Mjomba. That, I swear."

Part of Samatar wished the same could be said of his brother.\n\nThe election had already been called by that ungodly hour, with the usual speeches to the followers on both the winning and losing sides. And yet the sky was still aflame with orange fireworks, as the People’s African Party’s supporters celebrated their victory. The Continental Popular Front wasn’t as pleased, but Walaalkaa didn’t seem too hung up on it as the two Barre brothers shared a drink on the office balcony.\n\n‘We won a lot of seats tonight,’ Walaalkaa said, taking a sip of his tea. ‘Enough you and the PAP honest, hopefully.’\n\nSamatar chuckled. He didn’t look forward to the looming clashes on the parliament floor, but he’d feared worse. ‘The people wanted a fair election, and they got one. They clearly have a lot of faith in you to deliver.’\n\n‘Not as much as they do in you. I shouldn’t have to tell you not to squander that. Everything is on the line right now. Our people. Our culture. Our future. We can’t lose that, either from within or without.’\n\n‘You think me so foolish to throw it all away?’\n\n‘I think you willing to risk it all for your vision. A united Africa is admirable, yes. But not if it smothers the cultures that make it rich and vibrant. Not if it restricts the common man beyond opportunity. We have a genuine chance to free Africa for good and let it assert itself on the world stage. But the way the planet is… it may be our only chance.’\n\nIt was a familiar argument, and one that had spilled over onto the debate stage many times. But that last sentence was new. Walaalkaa and his supporters had touted their ecological plans and credentials many times throughout the campaign, but the polite fiction of the debates shied away from apocalyptic claims. But not even Samatar, in all his efforts to be jovial, could escape a certain existential dread that came with it.\n\n‘And we will not waste it,’ Samatar said. ‘I know not what the future holds, brother. But I promise you that I do not intend to face it alone. Not when I can have my brother by my side.’\n\nWalkaala smirked, eyes turning back to the fireworks. ‘Just remember that when parliament resumes."

Yet, despite the tranquility of the setting, he was still unsure as to why his predecessor, President Samatar, had invited him to this innocuous seaside village. Just as the thought circled his mind, the former president approached and sat down beside Kanai. Even with his reputation as a modest man, a certain gravitas still surrounded his presence.\n\n”First things first, congratulations. It takes a certain level of intellect, cunning and self-belief to navigate the Federation’s politics. Ever since I heard your name mentioned back in Hargeisa, I knew you’d amount to something great.”\n\nKanai felt a smile creep along his face in response to Samatar’s generous words. “Thank you, Great Uncle. But may I ask something? Why have you asked to see me here?”\n\n”Look out into the water again, Kanai. You see a little spire poking out, no?” Samatar pulled a finger out from his crossed hands to point into the sea. “That is the remnants of the city that used to be here. It used to be a giant hub, not too dissimilar from Nairobi or Kigali. Dar Es-Salaam, it was called.”\n\nKanai’s smile turned to a confused, inquisitive look. “What about it? We all know of the Great Mistake and the lessons we learnt from it.”\n\nSamatar sheathed his finger back into his hand and replied. “We were too cocky and headstrong. We made advance after advance, discovering what was possible for humans to do. In the end, that’s what broke everything. We had too much of that self-belief and we relied too much on our technical prowess, when that prowess was drowning our people and killing our crops.”\n\nClearly holding back a defensive frown, Kanai merely asked “What are you trying to impart onto me here?

He’d been optimistic about his chances of electoral victory, but the weight of responsibility had only dawned on him when the election had been called in his favor. He prayed to Allah for the wisdom to lead, and that the change of government would be for the betterment of Africa.\n\nHis brother Samatar stood waiting outside in the cool shade of the mosque’s garden. Walaalkaa wasn’t surprised that he hadn’t entered - he’d made his stance on religion clear long ago. Seeing him smiling was definitely a shock, though, leaving Walaalkaa wondering if it was just for show.\n\n‘Ah, if it isn’t the President!’ Samatar said. ‘Congratulations, brother. I’m proud of you.’\n\n‘Thank you, Samatar. I hope I don’t have to clarify that none of this has been personal…’\n\nSamatar shook his head. ‘The people wanted a change, and they made their choice. I just hope that they will not come to regret it.’\n\nWalaalkaa sighed. There it was. ‘I’m not about to cause another Congo Crisis, brother. Nor do I seek to abandon our plans to unify Africa. I only want to correct the course. That’s all.’\n\n‘If it were just you, I would believe that. But some of the others in your party… well, they’ll be judged at the next election, won’t they?’\n\nWalaalkaa offered a wordless nod. He disagreed with his brother on much, but couldn’t bring himself to strain their relationship by prolonging their arguments.
