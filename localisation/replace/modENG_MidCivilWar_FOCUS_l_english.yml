 ENG_The_Republic_Endures:0 "The Republic Endures"
 ENG_The_Republic_Endures_desc:0 "Victory at last! This terrible storm has finally subsided thanks to the valiant efforts of our brave loyalists, willing to stand by the Prime Minister until the end. Their loyalty and hardships will be rewarded, of course. A new England is on the horizon, and a new party free of corruption, embezzlement and inefficiency. In time, we might yet lead a new Industrial Revolution!"
 ENG_Emergency_Powers:0 "Emergency Powers"
 ENG_Emergency_Powers_desc:0 "A state of emergency was declared when the civil war began, but these emergency measures must be increased. Prime Minister Taylor's authority over the government will remain absolute for the duration of this crisis, allowing her to reshape the old systems into something that will weather this storm. Let us all stand behind the Prime Minister for a new party, and a new England!"
 ENG_Hold_Against_The_Traitors:0 "Hold Against The Traitors"
 ENG_Hold_Against_The_Traitors_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, all born from a personal hatred of us, or at least our party and its bleak history. We will weather their onslaught regardless. This may be a wind we have sown, but we still have a chance to reclaim our nation and create a true industrial power despite their violence."
 ENG_Reclaim_The_Nation:0 "Reclaim The Nation"
 ENG_Reclaim_The_Nation_desc:0 "We have brought some semblance of stability to the regions under our control, now the time has come to reclaim the parts of the nation still occupied by the traitors. This government is the only rightful force in the land, and was elected by democratic mandate. We will not stand for treason, nor subversion of democracy!"
 ENG_The_WouldBe_Dictator:0 "The Would-Be Dictator"
 ENG_The_WouldBe_Dictator_desc:0 "Nigel John-Hall has been perhaps the most fierce opposition to our government for decades. Founder of the reviled English Front, his doctrine espouses radical regression, violence and authoritarianism the likes of which England has never, nor must never see. To defeat him would be a favour to the history of the nation herself."
 ENG_The_EcoPuppet:0 "The Eco-Puppet"
 ENG_The_EcoPuppet_desc:0 "Rumours of foreign meddling in this crisis abound, but nobody embodies this more than Cassie Kenney and her 'English Spring' party. Time and again, these eco-radicals have proven that they are nothing more than an INTEGR puppet, spouting every talking point the Germans ever make like a raving mad parrot. They must be driven into the sea, lest England become a toy of INTEGR and Kenney's insane ramblings."
 ENG_Taking_England_Back:0 "Taking England Back"
 ENG_Taking_England_Back_desc:0 "We are prepared. The enemies of our legitimate government must not be allowed to foment and fester any longer. Let us begin a grand offensive and reclaim England in its entirety from the clutches of treason and vile ideology!"
 ENG_The_Loose_Dove:0 "The Loose Dove"
 ENG_The_Loose_Dove_desc:0 "None can say that Mr. Burr is not a charismatic man who holds popularity both inside and outside of the government, but his defiance of our authority and his opportunism in this time of crisis has shown he cannot be trusted. His militia are no match against our forces. Let us drive the rogue Minister and his 21st Century thought into the ground."
 ENG_It_All_Came_Tumbling_Down:0 "It All Came Tumbling Down"
 ENG_It_All_Came_Tumbling_Down_desc:0 "We had never thought it would come to this. Conflict and unrest was expected, but we had hoped that the risk of all-out civil war would be avoided when we joined the NSA. Clearly, we were wrong.\n\nWhat fools we have been."
 ENG_Muster_What_Remains:0 "Muster What Remains"
 ENG_Muster_What_Remains_desc:0 "The New Labour Party has ruled this nation for half a century. Many believe we have brought it to ruin…and perhaps they were right. But we are not the NLP of old. Prime Minister Taylor has made her plans clear, and already her efforts have borne fruit before the Civil War even began. If the nation stands by her, we will weather this storm and come out the other side a proud new nation."
 ENG_Appeal_To_Scotland:0 "Appeal To Scotland"
 ENG_Appeal_To_Scotland_desc:0 "We placed our trust in the Scottish when we joined their alliance. We have cooperated the best we can, and yet England burns. But now is not the time to shift blame, we must appeal to Scotland for help.\n\nWe must take care how much we beg, however. If we give in to every Scottish demand, we may win, but what comes out of the other side might just be the puppet that our rivals claim us to be."
