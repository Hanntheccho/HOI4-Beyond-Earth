  UKR_eurasian_dominance:0 "Eurasian Economic Dominance"
  UKR_eurasian_dominance_desc:0 "Following Eurasia's occupation of Eastern Ukraine in the late 21st century, our nation has been effectively shackled by Eurasian enterprises. Russian businessmen own our factories, plantations, even minor army units. It is imperative that we stabilize this relationship... or find someone else to stand beside."
  UKR_eurasian_dominance_red:0 "§RUntil we throw off the shackle of Eurasia, our economy will remain dependent on the Union State's whims.§!"
  UKR_all_slavs:0 "All The Slavs"
  UKR_all_slavs_desc:0 "Ukraine is home to many Slavic groups. Besides the Ukranians and Russians, former Belorussians, Vostaslavs, Poles, and international citizens all seek refuge besides the Danube. Unfortunately, sometimes diversity breeds chaos, and these groups all struggle to live in peace with one another."
  UKR_all_slavs_red:0 "§RUntil we deal with the many Slavic groups within our country, there is no way to prevent sabotage and ethnic clashes.§!"
  UKR_country_life_support:0 "A Country On Life Support"
  KR_country_life_support_desc:0 "The Ukrainian nation has been the victim of floods, invasions, and political strife. A century of humiliation later, and Kiev's grip on the country teeters on the brink of collapse. Foreign actors, such as our Eurasian overlords, megacorporations, and even supposed friends in Germany have all taken a piece of the pie that is Ukraine."

  ukraine_event.1.t:0 "Eurasia Stands"
  ukraine_event.1.d:0 "Ukraine's history, before and after the Great Mistake, is an endless struggle against invading empires, seeking to subjugate or destroy its people, again and again, time after time. It's the same case with Eurasia - it has stolen our land, our freedom and turned us into nothing more than a puppet state, to be rotting in poverty and subjected to exploitation, merely waiting for a formal annexation within a few years. The Ukrainian populace, trapped between artificial borders, is furious. There is a desire, a burning passion to escape the thumb of the Russians, to create Ukraine from Syan to Don - yet it is risky, a gamble, for another defeat may be the final nail in the coffin for our statehood. If we choose to break free from the "Eurasian" yoke, from another iteration of the oppressive Russian Empire, our only path is standing with Germany, and their INTEGR. Or, if safety is of higher importance for us, we'll simply do nothing, and try to not rock the boat too much. Albeit, people of Ukraine won't like this choice in the slightest."

  ukraine_event.3.d:0 "The Government's decision to stay loyal to Eurasia has been far from well received. In less than a week, rioters and partisans have plunged the country into chaos, attempting to storm Verkhovna Rada. Pylyp Pavlenko has gone into hiding, fearing for his life, while strife and civil unrest threatened to fully collapse the government. Eurasia took the opportunity to intervene - its Southwestern Army quickly took over most important cities and critical infrastructure, installing unpopular opposition figure Igor Dyachuk under the Slavic Federation Committee, all but assuring full control over Ukraine. With all possibilities of successful rebellion cut off, Ukraine's future as a part of Eurasia seems to be sealed."
  ukraine_event_option.3.a:0 "It was inevitable"
  ukraine_event.4.t:0 "Change In Our Course?"
  ukraine_event.4.d:0 "With Ukraine achieving true independence and aligning with INTEGR, its political scene began rapidly shifting, culminating in the 2201 general election. Multitude of parties participated, with only two reaching the final round - Ukraine's People's Party, led by current president Pylyp Pavlenko, and Ukrainian chapter of INTEGR, led by Zora Honchar. The People's Party promises to keep Ukraine's way of life virtually unchanged, simply perfecting and building on the current state of affairs, while INTEGR plans to build anew, reshaping the country along the ideals of ecology, fair representation, and international cooperation. The polls predict a tie, but in the end, the upper hand is gained by…"
