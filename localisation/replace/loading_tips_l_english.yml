 LOADING_TIP_0: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.00]\n\n[UNKNOWN]\n\nLast one to die, Please turn off the light.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_1: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.01]\n\n[UNKNOWN]\n\nIn the year 6565, you won't need a husband, won't need no wife. You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too. From the bottom of a long glass tube.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_2: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.02]\n\n[UNKNOWN]\n\nThere all joints are so frail but the lands are enormous, there all trains were derailed to make room for the columns. Some words are for kitchens, and some for streeth corners. There eagles were ditched in favor of broilers, and even when kissing, I follow drill orders.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_3: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.03]\n\n[UNKNOWN]\n\nIn an isolated system, entropy may only increase.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_4: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.04]\n\n[Arthur C. Clarke]\n\nI am sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_5: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.05]\n\n[Howard Phillips Lovecraft]\n\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of the infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_6: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.06]\n\n[Miriam Godwinson]\n\nSome would ask, how could a perfect God create a universe filled with so much that is evil. They have missed a greater conundrum: why would a perfect God create a universe at all?\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_7: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.07]\n\n[Corazon Santiago]\n\nMan has killed man from the beginning of time, and each new frontier has brought new ways and new places to die. Why should the future be different?\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_8: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.08]\n\n[Ishi]\n\nI have no name, because there were no people to name me.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_9: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.09]\n\n[The Brothers Strugatsky]\n\nWe will make good out of evil, because there is nothing else to make of it.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_10: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.10]\n\n[Pravin Lal]\n\nI hold a scrap of paper in the darkness and light it. I watch it burn bright and curl, disappearing into nothingness, and the heat burns my fingers. Where has it gone? What has it become? I cannot shake the feeling that I have witnessed a form of transcendence.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_11: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.11]\n\n[Nwabudike Morgan]\n\nI plan to live forever, of course, but barring that I'd settle for a couple thousand years. Even five hundred would be pretty nice.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_12: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.12]\n\n[Jan Patocka]\n\nThe grandiose, profound experience of the front with its line of fire consists in its evocation of the night in all its urgency and undeniability. Peace and the day necessarily rule by sending humans to death in order to assure others a day in the future in the forms of progress, of a free and increasing expansion, of possibilities they lack today.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_13: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.13]\n\n[Frank Irdinger]\n\nBetween a sweet lie and a painful truth, we would rather have neither. Humans have proven that they are too inept to handle the truth, but are also too rebellious to stick with the lie. We lacked consistency and general competence. That is the human condition.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_14: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.14]\n\n[INTEGR Propaganda Poster]\n\nEurope will be green, or it will not be at all!\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_15: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.15]\n\n[The Epic Of Gilgamesh]\n\nHow shall I find the life for which I am searching? There is no permanence. Do we build a house to stand forever, do we seal a contract to hold for all time?\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_16: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.16]\n\n[General Bradshaw]\n\nIt is today, for the third time in our history, that America is reunified. Let us now throw down our weapons and live forever in peace.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_17: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.17]\n\n[Max Brooks]\n\nMost people don't believe something can happen until it already has. That's not stupidity or weakness, that's just human nature.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_18: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.18]\n\n[Suzane Marjorie Fielding]\n\nLife is an inherently depreciating asset.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"

 LOADING_TIP_20: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.20]\n\n[Plato]\n\nThe heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_21: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.21]\n\n[Aristotle]\n\nSome vices miss what is right because they are deficient, others because they are excessive, in feelings or in actions, while virtue finds and chooses the mean.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_22: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.22]\n\n[Li Po]\n\nWe sit together, the mountain and I, until only the mountain remains.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_23: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.23]\n\n[Aesop]\n\nThe haft of the arrow had been feathered with one of the eagle's own plumes. We often give our enemies the means of our own destruction.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_24: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.24]\n\n[Isaac Asimov]\n\nViolence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_25: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.25]\n\n[Robert E. Lee]\n\nIt is well that war is so terrible, or we should grow too fond of it.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_26: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.26]\n\n[Ali ibn Abi Talib]\n\nThere is no wealth like knowledge, no poverty like ignorance.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_27: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.27]\n\n[Vyasa]\n\nTo save the family, abandon a man; To save the village, abandon a family; To save the country, abandon the village; To save the soul, abandon the Earth.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_28: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.28]\n\n[Jack London]\n\nI would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_29: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.29]\n\n[Sadhguru]\n\nRat race is for rats. As a human being, you can consciously create what you want, without being driven by social compulsions.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_30: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.30]\n\n[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]\n\nWherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"
 LOADING_TIP_31: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.31]\n\n[Alexander Dumas]\n\nI am not proud, but I am happy; and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.\n\n▀▀▀\n▀▀▀\n▀\n▀\n▀\n▀"

 LOADING_TIP_40: "[DATALINK_ARCHIVE.41]\n\n[Jonathan Heeds]\n\nThe network node is the antithesis of the Golden Ages.
