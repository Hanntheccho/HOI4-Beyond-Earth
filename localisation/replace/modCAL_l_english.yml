 CAL_spartan_federation_desc:0 "Born from the ashes of nuclear fire, the Spartan Federation is a nation focused on martial discipline. Its principal self-declared duty is to fill the holes left by the million bullets fired in years of artificial conflict, which they claim is the product of a lack of honor and proudness in American society."

 CAL_corazon_santiago:0 "Corazon Santiago"
 CAL_corazon_santiago_desc:0 "Corazon Santiago was born in District 1 in 2159 to a family of pirates from Puerto Rico. When she was still quite young, her family fled to Central, where she was orphaned during the riots of 2165. Despite her age, she took her younger siblings and joined a survivalist street gang known as the Jade Falcons. She somehow survived the experience, although when she later reappeared in District 1, her siblings had vanished. Santiago never speaks of them, and their fate is unknown.\n\nIn old California, Santiago served as part of a settlement security force (the Red Panthers) and then joined the City Guard of Wayward Harbor, one of the largest villages in the District. She distinguished herself as a battalion commander when the city was attacked by a warlord. This service won her much fame, setting her on a path to found the Spartanists, a selective order of survivalists who stake out a living in old California by destroying bandit hideouts and collecting protection tribute from settlements.\n\nExcellent discipline, physical agility and ability to thrive in any environment led to her being regarded as an exceptional leader. Santiago has a powerful will and practices intense self-discipline. She is adaptable, aggressive, proud, and extremely tenacious. Her personality is one of icy self-control over volcanic rage, the result of her tormented childhood. She will stop at nothing to ensure her own survival and that of her followers. In the end, she has every intention of making herself the absolute ruler of old America."
