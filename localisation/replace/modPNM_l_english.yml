  PNM_the_fourth_branch_desc:0 "After the Siege of Washington in 2084, where the military forced the pre-Mistake government into exile in order to break the political deadlock that only exacerbated the chaos gripping the country from disasters and militia violence, the Central government was never truly able to fulfill their promise of "restoring the government". Even though all three of the pre-Mistake branches are present, it's only the Executive that has any practical ability to pass policy, and even they are beholden to the Joint Chiefs.  This has led to the military often being described as "The Fourth Branch" - mostly by anti-Central factions lambasting it as a glorified military dictatorship, but occasionally by members of the Central military who feel they deserve the political influence they wield for "protecting democracy"."
  PNM_rock_bottom_popularity:0 "Rock-Bottom Popularity"
  PNM_rock_bottom_popularity_desc:0 "While the many Districts disagree, often violently, they have one agreement in common; "Central is the worst". Even citizens living within the region the Central government directly controls hate them, to the point that the military police cannot contain the rising protest movements. Whoever the Central Council appoints as President, they will need to deal with the protestors... one way, or another."

  PNM_central_council:0 "Central Council"
  PNM_central_council_desc:0 "In the pre-Mistake era, a phrase often associated with the United States was "It can't happen here". This sentiment was for a multitude of scenarios the citizens felt would only be plausible in elaborate works of fiction; disastrous weather tearing down entire cities, American citizens killing each other in the streets, the White House and Capitol Building being stormed by soldiers to establish martial law. Then when the Great Mistake choked the skies with ash, rising tides swallowed entire states whole, militias and gangs waged violence from coast-to-coast, and the military launched the Siege of Washington in 2084, almost every concept that Americans believed couldn't happen, did happen.\n\nWhile the Central government still has vestiges of the pre-Mistake branches of government, and had theoretically shed the pre-Mistake jingoism by adopting Canada and Mexico in a "Greater American Identity", the "national rebirth" via military coup has made the Legislative and Judiciary branches rife with corruption and Machiavellian power schemes at best, and glorified rubber stamps for the President and Joint Chiefs at worst. The Executive branch, despite having the best security on the continent, routinely had their administrations prematurely ended by assassination, leading many to believe even they are but a puppet to the military, and those who don't follow the whims of their generals will have their own security turn on them like the Praetorians of Imperial Rome. Of course, how much of this is truth, and how much is anti-Central conspiracy theory, is ill-defined.\n\nWith President Cygan having finished his term in office, citing health concerns as the reason he won't run for reelection, the question of who will lead the Central government is once again open to debate.  The "ongoing crisis" has long since thrown any elections from the common citizenry out the window, most especially after the Districts, while in-theory still under Central administration, in-practice became effectively independent nation-states with little loyalty paid to Central beyond the bare minimum of lipservice.  Thus, the "Central Council" - the unofficial name for the roiling sea of politicians, lobbyists, officers and spies feuding for power - is convening to select a new President, and perhaps implement some broader government reforms to salvage what little control it has left.\n\nThis could be the opportunity for the spark of democracy to reignite...§ROr be snuffed out, once and for all.§!"
