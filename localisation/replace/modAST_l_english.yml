  AST_lucky_country_desc:0 "For all the chaos that has wracked the world, Australasia’s ample land, educated population and wealth of natural resources has allowed it to navigate the crises with a relative degree of prosperity. Deep-rooted political and environmental issues still loom large, and not all have prospered equally, but the country’s exports have kept it afloat while so many others have drowned. Compared to other nations that survived the Dark Days, the people of Australasia have some precious semblance of normalcy, and even a degree of pride for how lucky they are to live there."
  AST_the_sunburnt_country:0 "The Sunburnt Country"
  AST_the_sunburnt_country_desc:0 "Despite its wealth, Australia and its neighbours have been dealt tremendous blows by the Great Mistake. Once-iconic coastal cities have long since been inundated, taking with them the infrastructure that once supported most of the population. Communities further inland often suffer under multi-year drought, broken only by devastating storms and flash flooding. Long-touted technological solutions have provided only limited - and often expensive - reprieve, while relief funds are strained when they exist at all. Now, with the authorities growing increasingly stretched under tightening budgets, the bush is growing underpoliced and dangerous to traverse without protection."
  AST_dented_defense_force:0 "Dented Defense Force"
  AST_dented_defense_force_desc:0 "The coup of the former United States left Australia without its primary defense partner, and the establishment of the Federation has done little to improve matters. The air force is still reliant on old American imports, with local designs being too plagued by pork barreling and cost overruns to be serious contenders. The navy has fared little better, with the loss and disruption of shipyards due to rising sea levels meaning that ‘next-gen’ vessels are typically last-gen by the time they’re completed. Meanwhile, the army has become little more than a glorified disaster relief agency, endlessly responding to one natural disaster after another."
  AST_militarizing_opposition:0 "Militarizing Opposition"
  AST_militarizing_opposition_desc:0 "Ceding Western Australia to corporate interests was a desperate move, and - while it has made the country’s financial position better than it could have been - it has had far-reaching consequences politically. To say the decision was controversial would be an understatement, as would be saying that is has emboldened radical political movements across Australasia. To make matters worse, many of these movements have responded to the growing lawlessness outside urban areas by establishing formal or informal militias to protect their assets and supporters. Now, some are capable of fighting not only on the political battlefield, but the physical as well."
  AST_rumblings_in_the_pacific:0 "Rumblings in the Pacific"
  AST_rumblings_in_the_pacific_desc:0 "Since the inception of the Federation of Australasia, Australia has remained politically and economically dominant over other nations within the Federation. While this is not unexpected, given its much larger population and landmass, many in the Pacific believe that they are not getting a fair go. The bulk of the Federation’s wealth is concentrated in Australia, with precious few scraps left for its Pacific allies. Increasingly tight aid budgets are also hitting these shrinking islands the hardest, as rising sea levels and extreme weather threaten their already diminished infrastructure. With New Zealand increasingly becoming the voice for its smaller neighbours, this festering inequality is set only to worsen without action."

  australasia.1.t:0 "Storm Clouds Over the Pacific"
  australasia.1.d:0 "The Federation of Australasia. Once, it was the envy of the Pacific - a union of nations that overcame the worst of the Great Mistake through resourcefulness, hard work, and more than a little luck. Australia, New Zealand and their Pacific Island neighbours managed to navigate the Dark Days relatively intact, though this did not come without sacrifices. Nor has it come without consequences.\n\nThe heyday of the Federation is long gone. Despite the best efforts of reformist Prime Minister Rhonda Campbell, corruption and cronyism infest the political establishment. Public services strain under insufficient resourcing, hampering disaster recovery and law enforcement when they are needed most. So too does the economy grow increasingly inequitable, bringing hardship and discontent to more people with each passing year. Perhaps as a result, sizeable opposition movements are on the rise. And with the regions beyond the cities growing underpoliced, these movements are as well-armed as they are dissatisfied.\n\nThe Free Australasia - or Free Aus - Movement has become the closest to a proper opposition to the Federalist establishment parties. Denounced by some as nostalgics pining for the pre-Mistake days, the truth is more complicated. Its leader, Ian Forscythe, is not blind to the realities of the 23rd century or the flaws of preceding eras. But as disillusionment becomes the cultural zeitgeist of the day, he maintains that pre-Mistake values of mateship and the fair go are crucial blueprints for reinventing the Federation into a more egalitarian society. And he has found an ample audience for his views.\n\nMeanwhile, among the forgotten and the downtrodden, the Bushrangers grow in popularity. Originally a First Nations survivalist movement, under the leadership of Aunty Sarah Gurruwiwi it has since come to offer aid to anyone abandoned by the Federalist government. In addition to helping struggling communities recover from disasters and protecting them from banditry, the Bushrangers have begun to find their voice in the political sphere. They represent a big tent of views, from traditionalists lamenting humanity’s disconnect from nature to accelerationists seeking a new culture founded upon rationality. Many consider the Bushrangers a glorified militia little better than the bandits they fight, but to others they are an indispensable source of hope in a nation that has left them behind.\n\nEven without the growing dissent, Australasia finds itself in a precarious position. New Zealand and Pacific Island nations openly question Australia’s disproportionate influence over the Federation. Westralia - essentially sold to corporate interests in the Federation’s most desperate hour - faces mounting civil conflict between its reigning corporatists and embattled union movement. Even to the north, divisions within the Nusantaran Association send shockwaves throughout the Pacific, leaving the region’s future unclear."

  australasia.2.t:0 "A Land Down Under"
  australasia.2.d:0 "The Federation of Australasia is a fading beacon of a country. The centuries since its conception haven’t been kind to the once hardy people of this untamed land and its formerly untarnished image of freedom, rugged lands and hard yakka.\n\nInitially with the catastrophe that was The Great Mistake, shaking the civilized world asunder, the governments of Australia, New Zealand and several Pacific Island nations agreed to a federalisation of their peoples. On paper, the plan was perfect. The close-knit community of peoples would have each other's backs through thick and thin, specializing on sectors which suited their situation. The Federation of Australasia would become a lone glimmering star amongst the ruins.\n\nRecently, this cooperative agreement has taken a sharp nosedive. All sectors, from its economy to its productivity and civil freedoms, have been thrown to the gutter. Heavily reliant on coastal infrastructure and port cities, many of the developed areas were unprepared for the severity of the rising tides. In a highly controversial move, the Federal Government auctioned off the administrative rights for the mineral rich Western territories in exchange for economic and financial support from rich multinational corporations. However, this newfound stability and wealth allowed complacency to slowly wriggle its way into the Australasian government, choking it from within. Leaders became weak, extending parliamentary powers or failing to resolve public issues, ultimately resulting in the ineffective and corrupt establishment today. The current Prime Minister, Rhonda Campbell, has her hands tied and is unable to bring about the much-needed reform the federation needs.\n\nThe situation is steadily mounting against Campbell and her unheard attempts at change. Civil unrest has been oozing out onto the streets, secessionist movements have titillated the pacific and parliament is still in constant deadlock.\n\nThe future of the great southern land is uncertain, but it's clear only a truly hard-out attempt from the establishment will prevent competing forces from taking charge themselves."

  australasia.3.t:0 "Merry Gang of Outlaws"
  australasia.3.d:0 "	Long marginalized in Australian politics, First Nations communities were among the hardest hit by the Great Mistake. Torres Strait Islanders watched helplessly as their island homes sank beneath the waves, while Aboriginal Australians found themselves at the bottom of the priority list for disaster relief. With nobody else to turn to, they turned inwards and to each other, forming networks to coordinate aid between communities. As desperation grew and it became harder for the authorities to police the bush, these communities began to form their own defensive militias. It was from them that the Bushranger movement was born.\n\nThe name was originally leveled at them as an insult, but they decided the name fitted them. They were not bushrangers in the vein of bandits like Ned Kelly or Jack Donahue, but hardened survivalists with an ancestral knowledge of the land that became increasingly valuable in their efforts towards self-sufficiency. In fact, it was this same knowledge that gave young militiawoman Sarah Gurruwiwi - fresh off her walkabout to lands and communities across the Northern Territory - a very ambitious idea.\n\nHaving seen firsthand the despair and suffering of those overlooked or ignored by the government, Gurruwiwi led a campaign to reach out to them and render support. The starving were taught how to work with the land to farm bush tucker. Those threatened by natural disasters were offered adaptation plans informed by ancient knowledge of the land and times of hardship. Even the militias found their place, rallying to the aid of impoverished communities when the bandits drew near. Over the decades, the Bushranger movement came to offer support and membership to people of all creeds, united in their struggle to survive.\n\nHowever, their unity is a shaky one. While they’ve become a significant voice for the poor and the desperate under the now elderly Aunty Gurruwiwi’s leadership, not all agree on what its greater goals should be. Some believe that the world has lost its connection to the land and to their past, and only through reforging it can society hope to survive. Others instead focus firmly on the future, believing that new technologies and ways of living must be embraced to protect Australasia’s battered natural heritage. As experienced as she is in arbitrating such disputes, the fact that her own sons have taken sides leaves Aunty Gurruwiwi struggling to keep her beloved movement together."

  australasia.4.t:0 "A Fair Go"
  australasia.4.d:0 "During the mass migration of Australia’s coastal populus following The Great Mistake, the increasingly rapid urbanization and “modernisation” of Australia’s once untamed interior drew much ire from the farmers and community-driven towns. Towns became small cities, neighbors became strangers, and a hard day's work became an old-man’s-tale to the young service-worker or clerk.\n\nThis sudden and drastic change was not welcomed by the original inhabitants of the interior, who were told to adapt to the changing landscape or die by a progressively uncaring government. Despite most of these despondent people hailing from the older generations, at their core, the then-young Ian Forscyth brought attention to their discouragement. As people listened to the young livestock-herder, the more his ideals for a new Australia brought a shimmer back into their dejected eyes. Industrialism, transhumanism, genetic modification - he claimed they were all symptoms of a nation who had wandered astray and found itself without direction in a destroyed and uncaring world.\n\nForscyth’s told tales of the Australia of old, of The Dreamtime, the Squatters, Ned Kelly, the brave Diggers of WWI, Steve Irwin. His following only grew. His idea for Australia comes not from reform, but from rebirth. His process for implementing this has been noted for its over-complexity, but the so-called “Free Australia Movement” still remains a significant political movement even outside of rural areas. Lately, it has even found a support base in other parts of the Federation outside Australia.\n\nWhile many politicians refuse to take Forscyth and his circle seriously, a combination of a brand new century, a rapidly devolving political crisis and stark news from Westralia has begun to mobilize the Australasian people into testing alternative solutions. Perhaps Forscyth will indeed bring about the new and free Australia he so often talks about."

 #Leaders
  AST_rhonda_campbell:0 "Rhonda Campbell"
  AST_rhonda_campbell_desc:0 "Ever since the Dark Days, when Australia’s establishment parties realized that their authority had been practically cemented, laziness and lax governing began creeping onto the parliament floor. The corruption has essentially blended the main competing parties, becoming collectively known as the Federalist establishment. So secure in their power, little changes based on who’s in office.\n\nCampbell’s own father led the Federation once several decades before her. While her father’s status gave Campbell an edge and boost to her political career, it would never find good use when the time came. Having successfully won the 2199 election, the new Prime Minister came to realize how ineffectual the Federal government’s inner workers truly were. Pointless infighting, incompetent management and corrupt dealings made in broad daylight - issues that all ran far deeper than she ever realized. The Federation was a sham of a government. Campbell, educated but inexperienced, caved at the reality of the position she occupied. She was a scapegoat. She was not, as she expected, the head of a great pacific federation, but an object for the puppeteering corporations and blind masses to point a finger at.\n\nCampbell still has some hope that the future holds some true liberty, but only so much can be done when a knife is placed firmly at your backside. But with some masterful navigation of this political minefield and a ripe enough opportunity, Campbell may prove herself to be a new legendary figure in Oceania’s history."
  AST_ian_forscyth:0 "Ian Forscyth"
  AST_ian_forscyth_desc:0 "Forscyth’s entire essence could be condensed into the archetypal Australian man: fierce, brave, and always with good humour. Far below his smiling exterior, however, is an idealist who just wants his old friends and family back. Born and raised around the rural communities of central New South Wales, Forscyth hoped to live a simple pastoral life, singing and sharing classic Australian stories such as Waltzing Matilda and old Australian heroes such as Ned Kelly or Steve Irwin. His soft fondness for Australia would be met with little enthusiasm from newer urban arrivals however.\n\nSeeing Australasia’s future in the world’s past, Forscyth believes the current government is too corrupt and too far gone for reform. More likely the country’s tattered social fabric will unravel into anarchy before the Federalists even begin to formulate a proposal for change.\n\nTo Forscythe, the answer is as simple as it is paradoxical; look to the past, and look to the future. So many solutions call from the far side of the Great Mistake, from a time when ‘a fair go’ was more than a snide comment. A time when mateship forged unbreakable bonds that weathered fire and flood. He claims these old values must be synthesised with the new and coalesced into a radically new system. Nostalgic? Possibly. Audacious? Absolutely. But to be willing to be bold and take chances is an old Australian philosophy, and one that Forscythe stands by unwaveringly."
  AST_aunty_sarah:0 "Aunty Sarah Gurruwiwi"
  AST_aunty_sarah_desc:0 "Sarah Gurruwiwi’s origins are a mystery to everyone, including - as she likes to joke - herself. She remembers little of her birth family, separated from them during the botched evacuation of her town in the Northern Territory.\n\nIntrigued by aboriginal history, upon coming of age Gurruwiwi embarked upon a walkabout - a physical and spiritual journey into the wilderness to mark the transition to adulthood. Conversing with many along the way, she relished in their wisdom and shared in their pain. All around her, the damage inflicted to the land was poisoning its people. And she couldn’t bear to let it go unanswered.\n\nThe Bushrangers weren’t a new group when she joined. Rising the ranks and eventually becoming their spiritual leader, the group came to offer protection and aid to any who would ask in exchange for other services. Utilizing ancient knowledge of the land for farming and disaster preparation, these efforts proved remarkably successful among the downtrodden of Australasian society, spreading to the Pacific Islands. The Bushrangers thus grew into a much broader political movement representing the country’s underclasses and increasingly establishing themselves as a small but firm voice in Australasian politics. But a growing number within the organization question this approach, instead seeking changes to their traditionalist views, with even Aunty’s own sons standing at odds. Aunty Gurruwiwi finds herself struggling to reconcile deep divisions in her beloved movement, all at a time it can ill afford it."
