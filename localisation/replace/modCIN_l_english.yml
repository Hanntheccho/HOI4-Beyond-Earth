  CIN_last_bastion_of_american_prosperity_desc:0 "During the Great Mistake, many of old America's finest fled to the Great Lakes to seek shelter from the anarchy and floods that dominated the coasts. They brought with them vast capital, giving the dying Rust Belt quick injections of cold cash and propelling the Midwest to new heights.\n\nToday, the Great Lakes lay claim to what little remains of America's vestigial wealth. The Greater Chicago Area boasts one of the highest standards of living in the world, while Detroit is widely considered to be the manufacturing capital of the continent. Corporations can pursue their interests in peace, free from unnecessary government intervention and regulations. However, our prosperity may attract unwanted visitors, or even a full invasion..."

  CIN_the_century_old_problem_desc:0 "Following the collapse of civilization on the North American continent during the latter half of the 21st century, a Great Migration began. Millions fled the coasts in panic, bringing with them children, the old, the crippled. New Englanders and Yankees settled across Pennsylvania at first, but gang tensions and famines forced another migration further West. Even today, Michigan and other Eastern states have to deal with hundreds of refugee towns. Boys have grown into men and bit the dust in these settlements, and even lowlifes call the refugee camps 'cesspit'. Now that tensions are rising across Central's loose domain, Chicago finds itself in the position of rare governmental unity, and can take action as needed."

  CIN_great_lakes_committee_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Committee is a council of local leaders, career politicians, and corporate representatives tasked with the preservation of order and steady growth in the Great Lakes District. Although initially appointed by Central in the aftermath of the 3rd American Civil War, the Committee now functions as an independent political entity. Its members are often seen as ineffectual by the wider public, but without proper elections, things are unlikely to change."
 #POLITICS_RESETTLEMENT_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "The Resettlement Authority was born from the ashes of the Settlement and Survival Committee, founded by the Great Lakes Committee in 2184 to deal with refugees in the East. The Committee's members were chosen from a pool of corporate representatives and Strike Action leaders, but soon the latter displaced the former. The Committee, much to everyone's surprise, showed results by successfully resettling two million refugees in Michigan.\n\nMany owe their and their families' lives to the Committee's members, and are ready to fight for freedom. Chicago, already weary of the Resettlement Committee's growing influence, has tried to disappear and judge its members. However, the flame was already lit and now the Great Lakes are in civil war. The Committee has rebranded as the Resettlement Authority, laying claim to the entirety of the District and its oppressed inhabitants."
