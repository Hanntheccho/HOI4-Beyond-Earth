  CIN_last_bastion_of_american_prosperity_desc:0 "During the Great Mistake, many of old America's finest fled to the Great Lakes to seek shelter from the anarchy and floods that dominated the coasts. They brought with them vast capital, giving the dying Rust Belt quick injections of cold cash and propelling the Midwest to new heights.\n\nToday, the Great Lakes lay claim to what little remains of America's vestigial wealth. The Greater Chicago Area boasts one of the highest standards of living in the world, while Detroit is widely considered to be the manufacturing capital of the continent. Corporations can pursue their interests in peace, free from unnecessary government intervention and regulations. However, our prosperity may attract unwanted visitors, or even a full invasion..."

  CIN_the_century_old_problem_desc:0 "Following the collapse of civilization on the North American continent during the latter half of the 21st century, a Great Migration began. Millions fled the coasts in panic, bringing with them children, the old, the crippled. New Englanders and Yankees settled across Pennsylvania at first, but gang tensions and famines forced another migration further West. Even today, Michigan and other Eastern states have to deal with hundreds of refugee towns. Boys have grown into men and bit the dust in these settlements, and even lowlifes call the refugee camps 'cesspit'. Now that tensions are rising across Central's loose domain, Chicago finds itself in the position of rare governmental unity, and can take action as needed."

  CIN_great_lakes_committee:0 "Great Committee" #Great Lakes
  CIN_great_lakes_committee_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Committee is a council of local leaders, career politicians, and corporate representatives tasked with the preservation of order and steady growth in the Great Lakes District. Although initially appointed by Central in the aftermath of the 3rd American Civil War, the Committee now functions as an independent political entity. Its members are often seen as ineffectual by the wider public, but without proper elections, things are unlikely to change."

 #Events
  cin_event.1.t:0 "A Tale of Two Cities"
  cin_event.1.d:0 "For all Central’s propaganda about American exceptionalism, even the most impoverished dirt farmers and coastal scavengers realize just how far America has fallen. Its greatest cities are now flooded ruins, its once world-leading industries are a shadow of their former selves, and what little wealth remains is held by fewer people than ever. Precious few remnants of the old America remains, not least of all on the banks of the Great Lakes. There fled millions of people and billions in capital, driven from the drowning coasts and the parched south. But now, even this last bastion of American prosperity finds itself facing the same post-Mistake instability it has fought so long to avoid.\n\nIn the west lies Chicago, the seat of the Great Lakes Committee. Installed by Central to govern the district, it has been relentless in its goal of maintaining stability and prosperity. Compared to much of America, it has succeeded. With the bandits held at bay and ample water supplies on hand from the Great Lakes, Chicago has become an oasis of affluence on a devastated continent. But behind the façade, the foundations decay. With no elections or meaningful avenue of political engagement for the common man, the Committee’s rule grows increasingly guided by labyrinthine backroom politics or outright self-interest. Peaceful strikes and protests are routinely met with force, justified in the name of security and stability. And perhaps most worrying of all to the Committee, a growing threat has emerged to its authority.\n\nIn the east lies Detroit, now under the de facto rule of the Resettlement Authority. Originally formed as the Settlement and Survival Committee, it oversaw the resettlement of millions of refugees fleeing the East Coast. While Detroit and its surrounds remain dotted by hundreds of impoverished refugee communities, the actions of the Resettlement Authority to settle, feed and integrate many of these refugees has elicited it tremendous goodwill. So too has the Authority’s management of Detroit helped turn the city’s fortunes around, working closely with the American Reclamation Corporation and various other firms to once more turn Detroit into the manufacturing capital of North America. To the average citizen of Detroit, the Resettlement Authority has done more for them and their families more than the Great Lakes Committee ever will.\n\nIt is here in the east that the powder keg of tensions and competing interests is lit. The staff of a factory has gone on strike over low pay and long hours, with other facilities owned by the parent company threatening to do the same. A well-connected executive makes some calls around the Great Lakes Committee, leading to an entire platoon of NAU troops marching to retake the blockaded factory. Who escalated the confrontation is unclear, but footage of the NAU forces firing into the crowd soon circulates around the datalinks. Coming hot off the heel of similar incidents in recent months – a dizzying whirlwind of crackdowns, police actions and executive orders against growing dissent – the volatile District finally ignites. And life on the shores of the Great Lakes may never be the same."

  cin_event.2.t:0 "Violent Erupts in District 5"
  cin_event.2.d:0 "Reports of violent unrest are emerging from District 5 of the North American Union, days after shocking footage was captured of North American Union soldiers firing on striking workers.\n\nThe Great Lakes Committee – the local administration appointed by the NAU government in Central – has long been the target of criticism aimed at its policing methods. However, this recent escalation has proven a tipping point for the District, which has seen a popular uprising striking the NAU garrison in Detroit. Latest reports indicate that the garrison has fallen, its forces either driven from the city or defecting to the rebels. The Resettlement Authority, a local administrative board covering Detroit and its surrounds, has openly declared allegiance with the rebels and declared the Great Lakes Committee illegitimate. Footage is already circulating of Authority-aligned forces – some belonging to ARC Security and its subsidiaries – clashing with Committee-aligned troops.\n\nThe Central Council has released a joint statement, declaring the Resettlement Authority to be ‘a seditious mob in the employ of a treasonous corporation’, taking aim squarely at the American Reclamation Corporation. The ARC’s own board has denounced both the violence and Central’s backing of the Great Lakes Committee, claiming that it demonstrates ‘implicit acceptance for the brutalization of American citizens’.\n\nUnrest in North America is not unusual, with many militias, survivalist communities and even remnants from the Third Civil War eking out a living away from Central’s overstretched armies and the ARC’s mercenary security forces. However, direct clashes between Central and the ARC is an unprecedented development, marking a major escalation of ongoing regional tensions between the two over the control of various Districts. Worse still, District 5 has long been considered one of the wealthiest and safest regions in North America, raising serious questions about the ongoing stability of the Union."

  cin_event.3.t:0 "The Committee Calls for Aid"
  cin_event.3.d:0 "The recent developments in District 5 have provoked well-deserved outrage among Central’s supporters, but elicited little surprise.\n\nFor years, District 5 has faced steadily-growing opposition against the ruling Great Lakes Committee. While far from a perfect organization, it has succeeded in its goal of maintaining law and order in the Great Lakes region. But it made one critical misstep – failing to rein in the Resettlement Authority. Through its success in handling the swelling refugee population in the District’s east, the Resettlement Authority’s success in engaging with local communities in and around Detroit has left it vastly more popular than the Great Lakes Committee. And with growing ties to the American Reclamation Corporation, its political reach is now comparable to the Central-appointed administration in Chicago.\n\nThis bitter rivalry has now spilled over into outright civil war. While the Great Lake Committee’s actions in suppressing riots and dissent have been widely criticized for years, a particularly violent series of crackdowns – some of which specifically targeted ARC personnel – have gone too far. Galvanized by anti-Central sentiment and ARC agitators, the people of Detroit are rebelling and have driven the loyal remnants of the local garrison from the city. The Resettlement Authority has thrown in its lot with the rebels, ostensibly in opposition to the Great Lake Committee’s actions, though some analysts suggest that it is working to secure ARC’s dominance of the District.  Whatever the case, one of the few remaining pockets of stability in North America has descended into its latest warzone.\n\nThe situation has been widely condemned by both Central and the ARC, with both sides blaming the other for the violence. But so far, neither has made a move – Central’s eyes remain inwards due to the election, while ARC’s own executive board faces its own shakeup. More broadly, the other Districts remain focused on various internal crises and conflicts, leaving the fate of District 5 seemingly in its own hands for the time being. But if we were to intervene – and accept the risks of doing so – then we may just be able to keep ARC from seizing this vital District."

  cin_event.4.t:0 "The Authority Calls for Aid"
  cin_event.4.d:0 "The events in District 5 were long in the making, though the ARC never expected to find itself so deeply embroiled.\n\nFor years, District 5 has faced steadily-growing opposition against the ruling Great Lakes Committee. Under the guise of security and stability, it has steadily grown more authoritarian in its rule and aggressive in its policing. Assaults on peaceful protestors have become the norm, and any pretense of the people having a say in Chicago’s politics is long gone. This leaves Detroit a glaring contrast, with the Resettlement Authority successfully supporting huge coastal refugee populations and leaving it far more popular than the Great Lakes Committee ever was. It has also come to work very closely with the American Reclamation Corporation, who have proven instrumental in turning Detroit from a deindustrialized failed city into a pinnacle of post-Mistake Americana. The Authority – and by extension the ARC – is easily more popular than the Great Lakes Committee on the ground, and rivals it in influence.\n\nThis bitter rivalry has now spilled over into outright civil war. Following years of iron-fisted action against strikes and dissent, a particularly violent series of crackdowns by the Great Lakes Committee – some of which specifically targeting ARC personnel – have left the people of Detroit in a state of open revolt. Caught up in the violence is the Resettlement Authority, who have vowed to protect the people of the District from the increasingly repressive Committee. While ARC is hesitant to pick a fight with Central, the Great Lakes Committee’s actions leave little choice but to respond in kind. Now, one of the few remaining pockets of stability in North America has descended into its latest warzone.\n\nThe situation has been widely condemned by both Central and the ARC, with both sides blaming the other for the violence. But so far, neither has made a move – Central’s eyes remain inwards due to the election, while ARC’s own executive board faces its own shakeup. More broadly, the other Districts remain focused on various internal crises and conflicts, leaving the fate of District 5 seemingly in its own hands.
