KAZ_apple_of_asia:0 "Apple of Asia"
KAZ_apple_of_asia_desc:0 "The Central Asian Federation is one of the few countries fortunate enough to have evaded most of the Great Mistake. Its landlocked location, vast mountainous borders, and surplus of natural resources virtually guaranteed an age of prosperity as the elites of the world flocked to the Steppe. Despite war and political strife, the Federation stands tall."
KAZ_legacy_of_the_great_betrayal:0 "Legacy of the Great Betrayal"
KAZ_legacy_of_the_great_betrayal_desc:0 "The people of Central Asia have had a divisive history with their Northern friends. The Russians have both developed our cities, brought in arts and science, but also exploited our pastures and mines. However, no historian could have predicted the Great Betrayal, when the Eurasian Union State invaded our Federation. Through bravery and a little luck, we withstood the tide. Since then, our people yearn for a more peaceful age and will be difficult to mobilize."
KAZ_baikonur_cosmodrome:0 "Baukonur Cosmodrome"
KAZ_baikonur_cosmodrome_desc:0 "The Federation has been fortunate enough to inherit a large fraction of old Russia’s space program in the wake of the Great Mistake. When St. Petersburg cried its last goodbye and Siberia collapsed into anarchy, a large core of scientists sought refuge in old Kazakhstan. The Baikonur Cosmodrome, where their students study and create satellites, is one of the few functioning planetary space yards left on Earth."
