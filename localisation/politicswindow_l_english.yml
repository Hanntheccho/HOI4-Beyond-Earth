#HELP BUTTONS
 
 help_current_bills:0 "This top half of the screen is used for §bpassing bills and new laws§!. Click on one of the §b4 categories§! to open the §b6 bills§! within that you can pass. Hover over a bill to see its effects and which parties support it.\n\n§BPolitical Bills§! allow you to increase or decrease trade and conscription laws, but also allow you to justify war goals and send volunteer forces.\n\n§YEconomy Bills§! give you greater control over the economy. They can help you develop faster, unlock sliders, and are very helpful when relying on the free market.\n\n§GMilitary Bills§! can help you recruit more generals, expand the armed forces, train units faster or conduct research at greater speeds.\n\n§RProposition Bills§! are prerequisites for certain foci and decisions in your nation. These range from easy to pass popular bills, to the controversial divisive bills.\n\nWhen you select a bill, the Parliament will have a §bhearing on it§!. Your §bParliament Power§! must meet or exceed a certain §bpercentage§!, based on your political system and other factors, for the bill to pass. You have §b30 days to meet the required support§! or the bill will fail. If a bill fails, you can still try to propose it again at a later date. There is a §b60 day cooldown§! between every proposition.\n\nYour starting Parliament Power for each new bill proposed is equal to your party popularity at that time, plus the party popularity of any parties that support the bill in question. Changes to your party popularity during the hearing will have no effect on the bill."
 help_free_factory:0 "§bAn alternative to state planned construction§! is the free market. All economic systems (except for Collectivized Economy) allow the market to grant your country §bfree factories§!. The speed at which you gain factories is §bdetermined by your country's Development Level and Economy Law§!, and then adjusted by national spirits, decisions, leaders, etc.Every day, the bar to the left will progress by a number determined by the factors listed above. Once that number reaches §b1000§! (you can hover over the bar to check its progress), your country will gain a §brandom free factory anywhere§!. For developed nations with a strong free market tradition, gaining factories this way (as opposed to manually building them) is §bsignificantly faster§!. The drawback is that you are unable to choose which specific factory you will gain and where it will be placed.\n\nWhile what kind of factory you get is random, §byou can still influence the market§! via these sliders. The first slider allows you to choose between a §bcivilian§! (civilian factories and infrastructure) §bvs. a military§! (military factories and dockyards) focus. The latter two sliders allow further control: A higher §b"heavy"§! focus will increase the chance that the free factory you gain will be civilian, while the §b"light"§! focus increases the chance of multiple infrastructure levels spawning in place of a factory. Similarly, the §b"land"§! focus increases the chance of a military factory spawning, while the §b"naval"§! focus increases the chances of dockyards.\n\nThese sliders can only be adjusted to a certain level, and require an §bIndustrial Power§! investment of §b25§! to move by 10%. Please note that some sliders cannot be moved until you pass the "Military-Industrial Complex" and "Military-Industrial Integration" Bills in Parliament."
 help_corruption_help:0 "All states are prone to corruption. §bEvery day§!, your country will gain a certain amount of corruption, §bdetermined by your political system§! (societies that prize plurality and transparency are less prone to corruption than their authoritarian counterparts, national spirits, etc.)\n\nEvery increment of 10 (i.e. 10, 20, 30) will increase the corruption penalty. While lower corruption increments are negligible, §bhigher levels of corruption can cripple your nation§!.\n\nAdditionally, once corruption reaches an increment, it §Rcannot be decreased below that increment§! (i.e. if corruption is at 23% and you decrease it by 5%, it will only go down to 20%). Therefore, one must always §bkeep track of corruption§! and purge it before it can be allowed to spread."
