  sweden_event.1.t: "Norway prepares to invade us!"
  sweden_event.1.d: "Since the Great Mistake, Sweden was in a state of gridlock. Parliament couldn't agree on almost anything, and emerging parties simply came and went, without being able to secure a majority to pass important legislations. Just like the sea - Swedish politics ebb and flow, but stay the same no matter what. Ironically enough, though the water level across the world has risen, our political water still stagnates, as if they aren't really  liquid, but some sort of weird bluegrass. Now, we face another issue - Norway's aggressive rhetoric and army manoeuvring effectively confirm an oncoming invasion, and this time around a decision to mobilize immediately was signed unanimously."
  sweden_event_option.1.a: "Brace for the impact!"
