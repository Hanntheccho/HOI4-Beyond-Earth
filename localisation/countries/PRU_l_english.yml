 PRU_the_andean_century: "The Andean Century"
 PRU_the_andean_century_desc: "The century turns yet again, but the Andes stand tall. The world is crumbling under the pressure of ancient struggles and climate change, but the Andean Compact is stronger than ever. Bolstered by international investors, vast energy reserves, a literate population and good geography, the Compact is widely recognized as a world power. The citizens of the Compact enjoy many social, economic, and technological freedoms that are rare in other parts of the world. The Compact is in its golden age - and it's going to last."
 PRU_the_lithium_business: "The Lithium Business"
 PRU_the_lithium_business_desc: "Old Peru and Old Bolivia are home to some of the world's largest lithium reserves. Monopolized by local indegenous groups, the Lithium trade is one of the pillars on which the entire Compact rests. While international trade isn't quite as extensive as in pre-Mistake times, the export of lithium has made the Andes rich and powerful."
 PRU_economic_decentralization_crippling: "Economic Decentralization: §RCrippling§!"
 PRU_economic_decentralization_crippling_desc: "As of now, major corporations and interest groups control this country's economy. The government has little say on where to build, what to build, and when to build it. Any and all legislation is instantly met with a flurry of push backs and filibustering, while the parties are too busy fighting one another to form a united front."
 PRU_military_decentralization_extensive: "Military Decentralization: §RExtensive§!"
 PRU_military_decentralization_extensive_desc: "As of now, this country's military is partially under the control of corporations and interest groups. The government has limited control over a patchwork of militias, mercenaries, and a few official divisions whose loyalty is a little more than questionable. On the plus side, companies fund and equip their own forces out of pocket."

  peru.1.title: "The Compact"s Army"
  peru.1.desc: "A comprehensive army review, compiled by High Command and assisted by international advisors, has revealed the following about our land and air forces:\n\n-The Compact has insufficient manpower to wage modern war. Conscription will become necessary sooner or later.\n-The Compact"s industry is completely unprepared for total war. Heavy emphasis on light industry by previous administrations has left major gaps in military infrastructure.\n-There are insufficient armored and air vehicles to compete with global powers. However, local opponents like Brazil are estimated to be weaker in that regard, at least for now.\n-The Compact lacks proper orbital-air-land interoperability. This is partly due to an inexperienced officer corps but can be rectified by combat simulations.\n\nIn total, the Compact"s armies have potential, but are currently limited. Analysts agree that the current force is sufficient to carry the Compact through continental conflicts but dramatic expansion is necessary to attain global reach."
  peru.1.a: "We must prepare for war."
  peru.2.title: "The Southern Conflict"
  peru.2.desc: "Down South, the Argentines are fighting tooth and nail for their blasted land. Refugees are swarming into our lower outposts and threaten to overrun critical military installations. It may be in our interest to help one side end the civil war… or we can supply all participants to make sure that Argentina remains divided and weak."
  peru.2.a: "Help the Grand Council."
  peru.2.b: "The military government must not fall!"
  peru.2.c: "Play them against one another."
  peru.3.title: "Overtures From The Compact?"
  peru.3.desc: "The Andean Compact to our North has sent a delegation asking for the establishment of an official embassy in our capital. While the Compact has been widely accused of being self-serving and opportunistic, it can be a valuable ally and protector in these hard times. It will also allow for future trade deals to fix our economy."
  peru.3.a: "Agreed"
  peru.3.b: "We don't need this"
  peru.4.title: "Argentina Accepts Embassy"
  peru.4.desc: "Good news! The wise Argentine nation has accepted our overtures and we now have an embassy in their capital. Diplomatic relations are expected to improve from this point on and we can count them as an ally to the Compact."
  peru.4.a: "Good"
  peru.5.title: "Argentina Rejects Embassy"
  peru.5.desc: "Despite our best overtures, the Argentine government has declined to host our embassy in their capital. Citing war profiteering, corruption, and other unfounded reasons, the Argentines have insulted us. We must view them as a potential enemy from this point on."
  peru.5.a: "Their loss"

#PRU_pax_andeana: "Pax Andeana"
#PRU_pax_andeana_desc: "A new century, a tale as old as time. The Andean Compact is experiencing a golden age oddly reminiscent of those met by old Rome and Mongolia. Trade is flourishing, the urban areas have never been safer, but some analysts fear that this prosperity is but a warning of the calm before the storm."
#PRU_over_the_amazon: "Over The Amazon"
#PRU_over_the_amazon_desc: "The Brazilians are preparing for war. Scouts and spies have been warning of this for months, ever since Manuel Branco Velho overthrew the old government in 2198. The nation is fully mobilized, but fraying at the seams. If we can just hold off until social order collapses in Brazil, the Compact"s safety will be ensured. A long line of forts can be constructed with the help of private engineers, for the right price."
#PRU_protectors_of_the_rainforest: "Protectors Of The Rainforest"
#PRU_protectors_of_the_rainforest_desc: "Now that the Amazonian Rainforests are ours, we can begin integration. Due to centuries of migration and poor rule, the natives are expected to meet us with open arms. We can provide food, shelter, and a future to these disenfranchised people."
#PRU_in_the_mountains: "In The Mountains"
#PRU_in_the_mountains_desc: "Despite the Compact"s power and wealth, there are still unconnected regions in the mountains. Entire ranges and rainforests have not experienced human contact for decades, but their development will be instrumental for any future war effort against Brazil. We should focus on expanding both civilian and military highways and rest camps in rural regions."
#PRU_sign_the_safehouse_petition: "Sign The Safehouse Petition"
#PRU_sign_the_safehouse_petition_desc: "A petition has been circulating in all levels of government. Proposed by the right wing of the Compact Guard, it calls for rapid arms expansion in preparation for the Brazilian, and other, threats. Passing such controversial militarization measures will be difficult."
#PRU_early_mobilization: "Early Mobilization"
#PRU_early_mobilization_desc: "None can deny that the world is changing fast. Wars are breaking out on every continent, civil wars kill entire nations, and yet here we sit, idle, plotting. By passing through a controversial legislature, we can start mobilizing the Compact. Our nation has sufficient strength to wage global warfare."
#PRU_limited_social_mobilization: "Limited Social Mobilization"
#PRU_limited_social_mobilization_desc: "An old proverb goes like this:\n\n"good times make weak men"\n\nWell, it"s quite obvious that we are living in good times, but nobody would dare call the Andeans weak. However, a push in the right direction is needed, and thus we must pass further legislation to begin mobilizing the population. Compulsory service, conscription, and factory work are all required if we are to win the Space Race."
#PRU_loja_arms_factories: "Loja Arms Factories"
#PRU_loja_arms_factories_desc: "Now that the Safehouse Petition has been passed, we can continue with minimal militarization efforts. With some corporate contracts here and some funding there, we can construct additional arms factories to fuel the future war machine."
#PRU_heavy_ordnance_contractors: "Heavy Ordnance Contractors"
#PRU_heavy_ordnance_contractors_desc: "The corporations have expressed interest in helping the upcoming war effort. By linking our militarization efforts, we can contract international companies and tap into their experts to build the most efficient heavy ordnance factories on the planet."
#PRU_great_andean_road: "Great Andean Road"
#PRU_great_andean_road_desc: "In ages long gone, the Inca, who dominated the territory that is now the Andean Compact, had constructed a marvelous road network that stretched from old Ecuador to old Chile. While our infrastructure is sufficient for daily civilian transportation, analysts agree that it will buckle if rapid mobilization is required. We should focus on recreating the Great Andean Road of old."
#PRU_quito_tractor_plants: "Quito Tractor Plants"
#PRU_quito_tractor_plants_desc: "Due to the difficult terrain that pervades the Andes, farming is difficult at best. Tractors tend to get stuck in the mud or hill crags, and accidents involving vehicles falling off trail ledges are not rare. We should invest in flexible tractors that can navigate the Compact"s geography without too much difficulty."
#PRU_arequipa_light_industry: "Arequipa Light Industry"
#PRU_arequipa_light_industry_desc: "We should prioritize light industry expansion. Tractors, automated plowing systems, new water purifier stations and other infrastructural developments will greatly help us in the long-run."
#PRU_newline_scanners: "Newline Scanners"
#PRU_newline_scanners_desc: "Information is power, and our RADAR network is hopelessly outdated. We should focus on sending more satellites into orbit and maintaining them to prevent another Kessler Syndrome. Newline is a new brand of satellite uplinks that promises superior geographic analysis and can penetrate the ground to locate metal deposits and enemy bases deep within the Earth."
#PRU_state_subsidized_education: "State Subsidized Education"
#PRU_state_subsidized_education_desc: "The concept of state-paid higher education is not new to the Andes, and already exists in certain urban communities. Unfortunately, outlying villages and poorer towns have yet to implement this policy. By enacting an already somewhat popular piece of legislation we can ensure a well-educated generation."
#PRU_order_more_terrabytes: "Order More Terrabytes"
#PRU_order_more_terrabytes_desc: "We must intensify computer power. Our artificial intelligence network nodes should be able to make massive calculations in short periods of time."
#PRU_maximize_lithium_extraction: "Maximize Lithium Extraction"
#PRU_maximize_lithium_extraction_desc: "Lithium is the lifeblood of the Compact, and we cannot let any amount go to waste. Most of the extraction efforts are done by corporations and indigenous communities, but their methods are becoming outdated. We should focus on researching and coming up with new and more efficient ways of handling the Lithium trade."
#PRU_the_army_issue: "The Army Issue"
#PRU_the_army_issue_desc: "The Army and Airforce of the Andean Compact are extremely decentralized. Corporations, public interest groups, and local communities all field their own militias and guards. The Compact will have to establish a united armed force to wage modern war."
#PRU_aiassisted_training: "AI-Assisted Training"
#PRU_aiassisted_training_desc: "The Compact is home to some of the world"s leading scientists, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence research. We can utilize advanced simulations to train the officer corps."
#PRU_persons_of_fortune: "Persons Of Fortune"
#PRU_persons_of_fortune_desc: "The Compact"s militaries include mercenaries and international warbands. While these are professional soldiers, reining them in can be quite difficult. We should promise them some loot in future conflicts in return for greater command over their strategy."
#PRU_kinetic_weapons_research: "Kinetic Weapons Research"
#PRU_kinetic_weapons_research_desc: "Kinetic weapons, or rifles that rely on high-velocity projectiles capable of piercing even the thickest armor, are the future."
#PRU_compacts_finest: "Compact's Finest"
#PRU_compacts_finest_desc: "Due to the prevalence of difficult terrain in South America, the Compact will have to rely on experienced strike teams, capable of traversing mountains and rainforests to get to the enemy. Army expansion laws and additional AI simulation courses are in order."
#PRU_healthaid_drones: "HealthAid Drones"
#PRU_healthaid_drones_desc: "HealthAid Drones, among other levitating equipment, can be used to supplement ground forces with first aid, construction, or scouting services."
#PRU_heavy_barrage_developments: "Heavy Barrage Developments"
#PRU_heavy_barrage_developments_desc: "The key to victory is preservation of precious soldiers and civilian lives. By directing artillery bombardment upon battlefield keypoints, the enemy is denied access to population centers and forced to take difficult routes."
#PRU_doctrine_loyalty: "Doctrine Loyalty"
#PRU_doctrine_loyalty_desc: "The fighters of our nation must know who they fight for. Be it for their families, for their ideals, or their nation. Either way, loyalty is a virtue, and every soldier should be reminded of that fact."
#PRU_walker_developments: "Walker Developments"
#PRU_walker_developments_desc: "Walker armor is the weapon of the future. Capable of traversing hard terrain but also carrying significant firepower, the Walker is a truly powerful battlefield asset."
#PRU_armor_innovations: "Armor Innovations"
#PRU_armor_innovations_desc: "War doesn"t change, and tanks still dominate the field, even 300 years since their first introduction in the First World War. We must keep up in the armor race with other powers."
#PRU_rule_the_skies: "Rule The Skies"
#PRU_rule_the_skies_desc: "Wars are decided in the air, and the nation that can provide the most orbital-air support via bombardment and reconnaissance will emerge victories, even with a sub-par army."
#PRU_payload_delivery: "Payload Delivery"
#PRU_payload_delivery_desc: "We should focus our research efforts on producing the fastest and most durable bomber fleets in the world."
#PRU_jet_prototypes: "Jet Prototypes"
#PRU_jet_prototypes_desc: "Bombers are useless if they cannot operate in the air war. We must invest in proper jet escorts."
#PRU_uplink_stations: "Uplink Stations"
#PRU_uplink_stations_desc: "Orbital bombardment is an expensive and long-term investment, but can turn the tide of war like the nuclear missiles of old."
#PRU_synthetic_fibers: "Synthetic Fibers"
#PRU_synthetic_fibers_desc: "Superior engineering will help ensure that our planes can outlast and outmaneuver their opposing counterparts."
#PRU_advanced_pilot_training: "Advanced Pilot Training"
#PRU_advanced_pilot_training_desc: "Our pilots must be the envy of the world. We should give them their own AI-assisted training courses to simulate real life combat and turn them into hardened veterans."

#PRU_south_american_neopolitics_desc: "The geopolitical stage of the 23rd century is muddy at best. Our embassy, spy, and diplomat networks are unreliable and require reinforcements to continue relaying useful information on other countries."
#PRU_southern_intervention: "Southern Intervention?"
#PRU_southern_intervention_desc: "We should consider intervening in the civil wars to our South. The Argentines have been at each other's throats for a while now and it is time for us to pick a side to support."

#PRU_power_projection: "Power Projection"
#PRU_power_projection_desc: "Our naval staff must be trained to meet enemy vessels on the high seas far beyond the coast. By projecting power across an entire Ocean, we can negotiate favorably in any potential wars with distant countries, and finally end the pirate menace in Oceania."
#PRU_protecting_the_trade: "Protecting The Trade"
