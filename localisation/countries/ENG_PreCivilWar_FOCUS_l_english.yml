  ENG_PRECW_Scattered_England: "Scattered England"
  ENG_PRECW_Scattered_England_desc: "Prime Minister Taylor is, without a doubt, in an unpleasant situation. The NLP is a despised government, and for good reason if you asked the PM. The ministers embezzle funds on a daily basis, outdated legislation means funds are located to counties that are underwater, the economy hasn’t recovered since Taylor herself was a child, and the famous British Stoicism has finally worn off as the people are outraged.\n\nBut the PM is certain she can stabilise the situation, assuming nothing too drastic occurs."
  ENG_PRECW_The_Birmingham_Uproar: "The Birmingham Uproar"
  ENG_PRECW_The_Birmingham_Uproar_desc: "The situation is far, far worse than anyone could have realised. The recent riot in Birmingham has displayed the weakness of our ability to control not only ourselves, but all of England. We cannot hope to continue the Status Quo despite what the fools in Parliament think - the PM must make drastic changes now, before things get too out of hand."
  ENG_PRECW_The_Sinking_Ship: "The Sinking Ship"
  ENG_PRECW_The_Sinking_Ship_desc: "The recent events in Birmingham have left the inept government in complete confusion over how to handle the crisis, their inaction and poorly thought out responses only making the situation more dire."

  ENG_PRECW_The_Bloody_Economy_desc: "Barbara Taylor stood against one of the pillars of the Birmingham Town Hall. She knew she was well in view of the news cameras and protesters, but she couldn't care less as she looked out over their heads. At what remained of Birmingham. Even weeks later, the streets were still awash with litter and ruin, but she couldn't say if that was normal or not. She wasn't sure what had and hadn't been torn apart by an angry mob, it all looked the same now. The ruined factories. The squatter warehouses. The chimneys of outdated steel mills half-toppled in the decades without maintenance.\n"Busy night, Barbs?" The man spoke up behind her. Tim Belley, that insufferable little idiot. She had evidence he had been sucking funds out of their relief efforts for at least twelve years, and she couldn't bear the little weasel on a personal level. "The lads are goin' out for a drink at six. You coming?"\nShe looked at him. At his ratty little face. At the city behind him he had helped ruin. There was only so much she could do before it all came apart. She took a breath. "Belley…""
  ENG_PRECW_Decapitate_the_Embezzlement: "Decapitate the Embezzlement"
  ENG_PRECW_Decapitate_the_Embezzlement_desc: ""Fired!?"\nThe wobbling, outraged voice of a man who had just lost a twenty-six year career broke through the thick walls of the PM's office.\n"I believe that's what I said."\n"You can't do this to me, Barbara, think of the-"\n"I've already got someone to replace you. You're out by the end of the day or you're spending the next in prison."\n"You'll not get away with this! You think you can just come in here and uproot what you like just because you won some hollow in-party election-"\n"John, shut the fuck up. Out by tonight. Don't come back. Ta-ta."\n\nThe befuddled minister slammed the door behind him, leaving the PM alone to look a little further down her list of names. She had gone from yelling at some incompetent managers…to having just dismissed the Secretary of State for Defence. And yet, it somehow felt like just another shouting match. An eye cast down to her 'schedule,' An impromptu list made on her laptop.\n"Foreign Secretary - OUT"\n"Home Secretary - OUT"\n"Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - OUT"\n"Secretary of State for Transport - OUT"\n"Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. - O U T". She couldn't believe that position was still held, let alone existed."
  ENG_PRECW_Sack_The_Useless_Ministers: "Sack The Useless Ministers"
  ENG_PRECW_Sack_The_Useless_Ministers_desc: ""Mr. Speaker, it is the declaration of this House that the Prime Minister must take swift and decisive action against this unsanctioned and un-English chaos that-"\nThe minister was promptly drowned out by the chorus of vague grunts and yells that constituted the traditional 'Hear Hear' of Parliament nowadays.\n"Mr. Speaker, while I can assure my Right Honourable Friend his trust in me is well placed, it is my obligation to inform this House that should these powers be granted, they will serve nothing but the good of England and her people!"\nThe PM sat back down as the chorus of approval-esque noises flooded the room. The vote would pass, she was certain. She was already thinking of what to do once it did."
  ENG_PRECW_Sack_The_Other_Ministers: "Sack The Other Ministers"
  ENG_PRECW_Sack_The_Other_Ministers_desc: "Born in Bath, Somerset, Arthur Burr's grandfather was an MP for the Labour Party. The old one. His father was a fairly apolitical man, his mother had been an avowed Harmonist, and his Uncle had been a fanatic member of the English Front.\n\n…Yet Arthur was leader of the Liberal Democrats. A party which had quietly endured throughout the turmoil. A party whose word was taken as nothing more than quiet resentment that could easily be ignored. And despite all that came against him, he endured. Despite how his family business was ruined by government industry. Despite how he was brutally beaten for his cybernetic left hand. Despite how his mother had passed away due to a Harmonist-led ban on the manufacture of the medicine she needed. Despite it all, Arthur Burr never abandoned his principles. Principles of proper democracy. Of an English spirit that was not drowned in hate and jingoist ideas. Of a future that did not lean on impossible ideals. Of a sensible government that truly cared. England had an identity, and no outside power nor fanaticism of the future could take that away.\n\nOne could call Arthur Burr the last moderate in England."
  ENG_PRECW_AntiCorruption_Legislation: "Anti-Corruption Legislation"
  ENG_PRECW_AntiCorruption_Legislation_desc: ""It is clear, now more than ever, Mister Speaker, that this House's trust in the Prime Minister has been thoroughly and severely misplaced!" The man was drowned out by another chorus of support, but it was distinctly muffled. Deadened enough that he could tell it was no majority. But despite that… he continued. He was no coward, and not a man who backed down against popular opposition.\nArthur Burr was a bastion of a party that hadn't been free of popular suffocation in decades, and calling someone a 'Liberal Democrat' in Parliament was synonymous with calling them an outcast nowadays. But Burr pushed on nonetheless.\n"I call that this house immediately issue a Motion of No Confidence-'' Again, he was drowned out by the rambling calls of approval and anger from both sides. "-A Motion of No Confidence not simply against this government, but against the Prime Minister herself, for this blatant disregard of the ruling system and of the democratic voice of the English people!"\nDespite the hurling of accusations and insults over her head from the squabbling groups… Barbara Taylor simply sat back in her seat opposite the man whose shallow husk of a party was all that remained in opposition. She did not rise to defend herself, nor did she show any smug confidence. She knew she had no need to stand and deflect the accusations, as they were entirely true, and either way, wasting her breath on a defence would make no difference. The motion was doomed to fail weeks ago."
  ENG_PRECW_Cut_Redundant_Relief_Aid: "Cut Redundant Relief Aid"
  ENG_PRECW_Cut_Redundant_Relief_Aid_desc: "Now that the opposition is effectively barred from Parliament, and the corrupt ministers of our own party are either defecting or disarmed, the time has come to formally pass legislation that will finally set this stagnant government on the right path. Harsh punishments, strict wording and catch-all clauses should do a fine job of keeping what's left of the NLP on the right track.\nIt may be too late for the rest of England, though."
  ENG_PRECW_Closer_Ties_To_Scotland: "Closer Ties To Scotland"
  ENG_PRECW_Closer_Ties_To_Scotland_desc: "In a time long forgotten, the National Health Service had been a respected institution. Public, free healthcare to all British, and later English citizens, funded by the government. It fostered generations of well respected, if often underappreciated doctors, nurses, paramedics and others devoted only to saving lives.\nBut with the Great Mistake and the gradual decline of England, the NHS was first overstretched, then underfunded, then bypassed completely as its position and obligations were slowly stripped away. Now, the National Health Service is nothing but a group of underpaid General Practitioners and nurses who offer little more than basic treatment or mundane prescriptions as their equipment and authority becomes outdated with the needs of the modern era.\nBut despite that, the funding for the NHS remains high, and anyone with an eye for the methods of today's government can see why. Money falls into the pit with the NHS stamp, but only trickles and pennies reach those who need it.\nThe NHS served its purpose well in years past, but it has come time to let it fade into history in service of a better tomorrow."

  ENG_PRECW_What_Comes_Next_desc: ""The smog is a little bit… unsightly, isn't it?"\nBarbara turned to look at him with an irritated gaze, and said nothing. "...O-Of course, it's… a great work of industry, Prime Minister. I'm just-" "Don't get Harmonist on me, Richard." She cut him off with a precise, passively threatening tone. "Of course not, Prime Minister…"\n\nThe two, or perhaps just the one, given how Minister Brey was internally fearing for the security of his job, looked out from atop a Birmingham skyscraper over the vast, rebuilt and fully operational factory district on what were originally the city's outskirts. Its existence had not come without some kind of outrage. The Harmonists were upset about its pollutant output, the Purists were angry about a few jobs being lost, and the increasingly vocal Liberal Democrats, those irrelevant whiners, were mad about all  of those things, and more.\nOf course…nothing could be done to silence the uproar now. Barbara had been waiting for things to escalate since the last time she looked out over Birmingham like this, seeing nothing but empty husks of factories.\nPerhaps, for just a moment before it all fell apart, she could be proud."
