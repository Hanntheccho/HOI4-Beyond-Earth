 CNG_I_Will_Not_Cease: "I Will Not Cease"
 CNG_I_Will_Not_Cease_desc: "War and death are upon us. Never did we think the turmoil would come to this, and we are not the ones who have cast the first stone, but we are left with no other options.\n\nMinister Burr has chosen not to take a side in this conflict, and his supporters stand behind him in securing themselves from the chaos consuming the land north of our holdouts. In refusing to pick a side, however, we have made ourselves an unwitting fourth contender to this chaos.\n\nWe find ourselves squarely in the sights of the Devil himself; John-Hall and his purists will not hesitate to bring our attempted neutrality to a swift and murderous end. For the sake of us all, we must fight. If it means risking everything to bring peace to England, so be it."
 CNG_Against_The_Front: "Against The Front"
 CNG_Against_The_Front_desc: "In such ruinous turmoil as this, only hope drives us onward. Hope for a better tomorrow. A tomorrow that the past once thought inevitable. For the sake of all that is good, fight! Fight for England!"
 CNG_The_Few_Who_Dare: "The Few Who Dare"
 CNG_The_Few_Who_Dare_desc: "Minister Burr knows the Front all too well. Their hate, their depravity and their vile demagogue, John-Hall. By their words and by their fists, they are to blame for this violence and death, and they must be stopped. Even if we may not emerge the victors of this new civil war, we have a duty to avenge England's pride. To take them with us."
 CNG_Hope_Glances: "Hope Glances"
 CNG_Hope_Glances_desc: "We cannot count on foreign meddling to win us the day. We are the only ones who refused to sell our souls to the greater powers, and the only ones to fight against them all. While this may have made us enemies, it has also made us friends. Like-minded people who dread the path England is taking, and see our cause as hopeful and just. They bring with them supplies, weapons, and most importantly, souls to stand against the chaos. We will need every pair of hands that can be mustered, and we are eternally grateful for their trust in us."
 CNG_Towards_Birmingham: "Towards Birmingham"
 CNG_Towards_Birmingham_desc: "The Lion is dead, slain by the arbitrators of justice. This victory means more than just a sigh of relief for England; it shows the world that our cause has strength, and our people are brave and capable.\n\nOur success has no doubt attracted the attention of the remaining contenders for the nation who surely shrugged us off as a distraction for the Front, and they will not take kindly to our elevation as a serious threat to their power. We must not stop here, we cannot. If we can defeat the Front, we can defeat them."
 CNG_Against_The_Spring: "Against The Spring"
 CNG_Against_The_Spring_desc: "The 'legitimate' government of England is nothing more than a collection of corrupt bureaucrats wading in the blood money that subservience to the North Sea Alliance has gotten them. They have never cared for England, and even the attempts of Prime Minister Taylor to 'fix' the nation, noble as they might appear to be, are far too late. To seize Birmingham will mean not only our greatest victory yet, but a massive boost to our prestige and legitimacy in the eyes of the nation."
 CNG_Unto_The_Breach: "Unto The Breach"
 CNG_Unto_The_Breach_desc: "Hope for the future is something that we share in common with the English Spring party, but their means do not justify the ends. While we preserved our political independence and were willing to compromise with our opponents, they have effectively enslaved themselves to the will of INTEGR and the Germans, and their methods have become more and more radical and extreme in recent years. Focusing our efforts against them will allow us to not only eradicate their extremist methods, but to potentially gain defectors from those who might be sympathetic to our cause among their ranks, and ready us for a final assault on the New Parliament."
