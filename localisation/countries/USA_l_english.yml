   USA_never_let_the_old_flag_fall: "Never Let the Old Flag Fall"
   USA_never_let_the_old_flag_fall_desc: "The Newfoundland Naval Junta is the last remnant of the ancient Federal government of the United States. Although its founders have long since passed away, the Junta's strict adherence to tradition has allowed its culture to remain more or less unchanged throughout the centuries. Its people have long developed a separate dialect from the mainlanders, but still consider themselves the true inheritors to the United States (and Canada) of old. But as the world crumbles around them, the inhabitants of Newfoundland are faced with a drastic need for action, and failure in any way may cause the whole house to come crumbling down..."
   USA_century_navy: "21st Century Navy"
   USA_century_navy_desc: "The Junta is based around its navy, but years of poor maintenance and outside advancements have caused the once legendary US Fleet to be more worthy of a museum than a high sea battlefield. This country lacks the proper material and expertise to modernize the fleet in a normal amount of time, and is forced to rely on aircraft carriers and transports to make a living space and trade for food respectfully."

   USA_ulrik_svensgaard: "Ulrik Svensgaard"
   USA_ulrik_svensgaard_purity_desc: "Ulrik Svensgaard was born in 2158, to a Newfoundland fisherman father, and a Massachusetts expat-descended barkeep mother. He spent his early 20s following in his father's footsteps before he suddenly joined the Federal Navy in 2176, causing a rift with his family that was never repaired. He served with distinction in naval patrols against Atlantic ocean piracy, earning himself a berth at OCS and an eventual appointment as navigator with the David Cameron Sears battle group.\n\nDuring the disastrous 2187 Battle of Baffin Bay, Svensgaard single-handedly rescued Flag Admiral Clarke and three other senior officers trapped below decks when the Sears' magazine exploded, costing Svensgaard the use of his left eye. For his heroics, he was offered his choice of assignments; when Svensgaard facetiously asked to be made President (claiming his leadership wouldn't have led to the Federal navy sailing bow-first into a massacre), he was shocked to find himself nominated as the candidate for the Republican-Democrat Coalition, effectively guaranteeing his election. Although such a state of affairs was mostly indicative of the Federal government's desperation following the 2084 Siege of Washington, it would be a mistake to deny how Svensgaard's own strengths as a leader would fit his newfound role.\n\nSvensgaard has the rugged determination and self-reliance of a man who has repeatedly conquered the elements on his own terms. He can be sensitive to his lowly origins, and seems to take pleasure in humbling those who believe they possess more impressive pedigrees or credentials. He is supremely self-confident, but he is unfailingly polite to his associates and follows a kind of chivalric code even with his enemies - assuming said enemies are ones he deems worthy of said chivalry, that is. He never seeks a fight that someone else didn't start and if he gives his word, it is good as a bond."
   USA_ulrik_svensgaard_divinity_desc: "When it came time to ask if weapons are more important than the world itself, Svensgaard surprisingly felt a soft spot for the wide-eyed kids who said they could make the very oceans something worth swimming in again. Perhaps it was because they were down in the dirt and mud where most Republicans wouldn't dare get their sleeves scuffed, maybe it was because he wasn't willing to give the brass any more pull than they already had, but Svensgaard has decided that the new America would be a greener America.  His new Democratic allies have promised him to make sure his forces will be at the top of their game; when it comes to reclaiming America, they'll have to be!"
   USA_ulrik_svensgaard_mastery_desc: "When it came time to choose between faith and firepower, Svensgaard has chosen Republican weapons tech over Democratic preaching.  Having told the tree-huggers to take a vacation at INTEGR's Germany, Svensgaard is now flush with technicians, entrepreneurs, and more officers than you can shake a stick at. Though there are times where he is irritated at their preening, and misses the days where every man personally held the trigger they were firing, Svensgaard does have to admit that robotic soldiers can compensate for the Federal government's woefully small population. He just hopes he didn't put all his eggs into a soon-to-be-recalled basket."

   USA_prepare_our_army: "Prepare Our Army"
   USA_prepare_our_army_desc: "Our naval forces are exceptionally strong. Well, they’re numerous at least. The same can not be said for our land forces, which are well equipped but not numerous by any stretch of the imagination. We should probably change that."

   us_junta.1.t: "Raven Head Bay"
   us_junta.1.d: "It’s been over 100 years since the US Government was forced off of the mainland, forced to set up home in their former territories and forced to merely watch as their homeland was torn apart by maniacs and opportunists. Despite this brutal experience, the last Americans in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Puerto Rico are still hopeful that they can retake what was lost. None of them believe this more than their leader, Admiral Ulrik Svensgaard.\n\nUlrik Svensgaard stood on Raven Head Bay, Nova Scotia. Looking out across the water, he could see the mainland from where he stood. He laid his eyes upon the shores of New England, or as the traitors would put it, “District 3.” Nary a single house stood above one story high, and nary a man stood above cover, lest he be a target for snipers. Bluehelmets and Public Safety Forces fought over scraps of ruined land that used to be under one banner, one flag, one glorious nation. But of course, Ulrik doesn’t remember what America was before the collapse, nor does anyone else in the US Naval Territories, however he can still imagine what it was like. The golden fields of Elysium on Earth, a global hyperpower that spread democracy and freedom across an Earth where tyrants used to reign. Ulrik can’t help but compare the supposed world the old Americans came into with the world his Americans will come into, a world divided among tyrants and brutalizers who lost any sense of morality long before they found a justification for it. The only way this global tyranny will end is when America retakes its vital place in the world, as protectors of the little man, of the free man, protectors of every man on this planet."
   us_junta.1.a: "God Save America, from the Americans."
   us_junta.2.t: "Deus Serva Americam"
   us_junta.2.d: "”Good morning citizens of America! You may be wondering why you’re receiving this message through the datalinks today, let me first remove any doubt or panic you may have in your mind about this message. We are not under attack. That would mean that we are cowards, waiting for the traitors to take the fight to us! No. We are taking the fight to them!” Ulrik slammed the desk in front of him and stared deep into the camera. “You are needed! Every able body is needed on the frontlines or in a fleet! It is only with the grit and determination of every single one of you that we will retake our home!”\n\nUlrik stopped talking for a moment or two, struggling to speak the archaic American language that his forefathers used for speeches such as this. “Let me abandon the old speak and speak to all Americans as clearly as possible.” Ulrik proclaimed, ditching the old language he had previously been using. A silent gasp bounced around the camera crew as the speech reached the moment everyone was waiting for.\n\n”We are formally declaring war on the traitors of New England and the American Reclamation Corporation, we call on all men and women in New England and Arcopolis to rebel, and revolt, just as our ancestors did against their oppressors! We are coming to save you from tyranny and to give you freedom.” Ulrik stood up and gave a salute to the camera.\n\n”God Save America.""
