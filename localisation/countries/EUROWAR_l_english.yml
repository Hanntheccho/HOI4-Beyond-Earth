 eurowar_decisions: "The Old World"
 eurowar_decisions_desc: "§LPrior to the Great Mistake, Europe seemed to be on the cusp of unification. However, these dreams were cut short by a general collapse of the economy and international relations. The European Union receded further West, while Russia occupied swathes of Eastern Europe. The years dragged into decades, but the memory of an almost united Europe never completely died.\n\nIf the consolidation of Franco-Iberia and the rise of INTEGR served as preludes for the new geopolitical situation in Europe, then the Italian Intervention and the formation of the North Sea Alliance marked the start of a new era. The Swiss Plebiscite of 2107 was the first major flashpoint of post-Mistake relations, followed by the Padanian movement and the unexpected entrance of the Balkan Federation into an alliance with the isolated Eurasia. The Eurasian Reformation that saw the transformation of the Russian nation into something uncanny further fueled the new flames.\n\nBut that is the past, and we must look to the future. Europe has fallen far, but its descent is not yet fully complete. To combat increasing social instability, the existing alliances all strive to unite the continent in their own image, either through diplomacy or combat.§!\n\nThus far, every major alliance has a specific level of §YInfamy§! that represents its threat level in the eyes of other European powers. Should this reach a critical level, all European alliances will be able to declare war on the suspected aggressor. This value will only drop on rare occasions, but will increase as the alliance grows in size and power, or engages in proxy wars in Europe. All Europeans are also bound by the §YTreaty of Bern§!, which prevents them from openly warring with each other for the sake of preserving the few scraps that still remain. However, as global conditions worsen, the treaty may yet be modified or outright repealed. Every alliance also has its own unique set of internal and diplomatic resolutions that it can pass, although many of these are restricted to the alliance leader. Finally, a unified Europe may exist once only one alliance remains standing, perhaps as a result of another Great European war…\n\n§ONorth Sea Alliance§!
