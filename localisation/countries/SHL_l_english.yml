 SHL_claudius_reid: "Claudius Reid"
 SHL_claudius_reid_desc: "Somewhere in the bleak and barren skyline that is Kalgoorlie sits Claudius Reid, the unwilling “president” of the Westralian Republic.\n\nBorn to a wealthy British family with strong ties to the business world, Reid would initially attempt to enter British politics and although very sharp, his lack of social charm or ability to persuade hammered the killing nail into his dream. Lost and alone in Britain, Reid soon discovered through his corporate connections that a new “Westralian president” was to be secretly chosen. Moving to Westralia, he hastily seized the opportunity and, to his delight, won the position. But unfortunately for Reid, there was a nefarious trap underneath lying in wait for him and he had fallen for it. Quickly sworn into office above a weary crowd of on-lookers, there was no applause and no gratulatory ceremony. \n\nSo in his office he sits, questioning, pondering and wasting away. Where there was once a vibrant optimism and hope in finally being able to effectuate political change, the black reflective walls of this hellish office environment remind him of his friendless and soulless position. And if he sometimes gathered enough energy, he would gaze down at the citizens below his office and almost certainly see the same gutted husks, coughing and choking at their own misfortune, oblivious to their helpless “leader” above."
 SHL_arthur_donaldson: "Arthur Donaldson"
 SHL_arthur_donaldson_desc: "Holding a dual geology-engineering degree on a mining scholarship and joining the mining industry immediately after graduation, Arthur Donaldson’s upbringing was an unremarkable one by Westralian standards. But he proved himself to be anything but.\n\nHaving grown up among the poverty and hardship plaguing Westralia’s working class communities, he developed a strong sense of class solidarity from a young age frequenting union movements and strikes.\n\nHis talent for geology and mining is considerable, but his ability as a leader is not to be underestimated. Many of his most loyal friends attest to his actionable character, reflected in his tactics of fiery speeches, mob enthusiasm, and plenty of strong-arm tactics. Some might accuse Donaldson of being a violent braggart, but he genuinely holds a worldview of an implacable class struggle which, he believes, can only be resolved through the destruction of the oppressors.\n\nThe Westralian authorities have done little to convince his followers otherwise. As corporate influences continue to dominate the pseudo-nation’s politics, and their lords grows increasingly draconian in their suppression of unionism, Westralia finds itself a powderkeg. Donaldson leads the largest union coalition in Australian history, but Donaldson is sometimes seen as potentially unhinged by some of his more temperate followers. His calls sometimes slip into demands and his more zealous fanatics scream and cry in manic mob mentality. He is no doubt a fiery man, and likely to be the only spark that could set the nation alight."

 SHL_a_free_country: "A Free Country, Or Your Money Back"
 SHL_a_free_country_desc: "The notion of Western Australian independence dates back well before the Great Mistake, but received a notable resurgence after it. It was easy enough for corporate interests to jump on the bandwagon, going so far as cutting a deal with Australasia for massive financial and economic support in exchange for an independent Westralia. Of course, once Westralia was founded, the fledgling nation was firmly - if discreetly - under corporate control. The politicians are in their pockets, the police are at their beck and call, and the entire country is theirs to profit from. That’s not to say they aren’t without enemies, be it on the floor of the Westralian Congress or the picket lines outside the mines. But they are often dealt with swiftly by corrupt media and even more corrupt authorities, leaving the profits free to keep on flowing."
 SHL_nothing_is_as_precious: "Nothing’s as Precious as a Hole in the Ground"
 SHL_nothing_is_as_precious_desc: "Much like the rest of the continent, Westralia is rich with natural resources. But unlike Australasia, there isn’t even a semblance of regulation standing between the corporations and the riches below the ground. Only the most token of conservation efforts exist, and even then they’re simply there to ensure that the local agricultural sector survives and remains profitable. For the most part, though, Westralia is a world leader in the export of raw materials and manufactured goods. Though visitors would be well-advised to purchase a breathing mask when they arrive."
 SHL_the_free_drones: "The Free Drones"
 SHL_the_free_drones_desc: "Mindless rabble, buzzing like drones in a beehive. Despite the Westralian corporate media’s best efforts to avoid reporting on it, the comment - made by one of Westralia’s wealthiest mining magnates on a hot mic - still did the rounds, causing varying degrees of amusement and outrage among the working class. It might have eventually faded from memory, had not the largest alliance of Westralia’s embattled unions appropriated the term ‘drone’. With each new day, each new worker mistreatment scandal and each new accident caused by lax workplace protections, the Free Drones grow in numbers and support. Efforts to suppress them have backfired significantly, backing them into a corner where many openly believe that violence is the final recourse for their voices to be heard."
