   URA_liev_ganin: "Liev Ganin"
   URA_liev_ganin_desc: "Liev Ganin never understood warfare in a technical sense. Having cheated his way through the Suvorov Military Academy, he found himself armed and sent into the meatgrinder of Central Asia. The campaign dragged on for many years, claiming all of Liev's friends.\n\nThe Great Rout came at the climax of of the campaign in 2157, by which point Liev's skill for improvisation and limited tactical expertise had landed him the undesirable position of general. Following the migration of Army Group South into the Urals, Liev settled in the mountain chain, drinking his sorrows away. However, either semi-consciously or through gritted teeth, Liev Ganin is digging up old hatchets."

   ural_event.1.t: "Orange-Red Sky"
   ural_event.1.d: "Liev Ganin - a relic from a bygone age. Sits in his office - run-down place, but still better than the rest of HQ - all week, probably fantasizes and runs over old memories. A glorified past is long gone, all that's left is this mess - Ivan and Zhluvov have already pulled the trigger, soon Yug Command will be a graveyard.\n\nLiev Ganin leans against a balcony railing, observing the charred ground below. The late sky is dyed red, with a faint orange line above the setting sun. Far to the South lies the old nemesis - Central Asia. The wind is so fresh that it hurts Liev's dried skin, he grunts and leaves.\n\nLiev Ganin lies on the mattress, empty vodka bottles scattered around. He cannot sleep, black spots rest under his eyes. Outside, the dark night is lit up by the forest fires, a brilliant display that digs into Liev's mind."
   ural_event_option.1.a: "Liev Ganin dreams without sleeping."
   ural_event.2.t: "Meaning"
   ural_event.2.d: "Liev Ganin shivers as he passes by the compound's guards. The heat and cold outside create a heavy fog, through which warlords are arriving. The snow melts under the weight of the white sun, Liev shields himself from it. The light burns.\n\nThe warlords of former Army Group Yug are a sorry bunch: old, disgraced, marshalling disgruntled veterans of a war which has faded into the abyss of the past. In the following hours, HQ and the rogues discuss strategy, but in the back of their minds rests a single thought, steadfast against the tide of history that threatens to wipe them off the face of a dying Earth - Liev knows what must be done, the warlords know what must be done, the soldiers know what must be done. Their job is not finished, the Urals are but a retreat, for in the South, their old nemesis, the cause of their disheveled state, the Central Asian Federation still breathes."
   ural_event_option.2.a: "To the South, lies Destiny."

   matters_of_the_urals: "Matters Of The Urals"
   matters_of_the_urals_desc: "\n\nThe scorched land beyond the Ural Mountains is as dangerous as it is vast. One can travel for hours past ruined cities and the remains of ancient battlefields, but only encounter a living soul in the form of a lone predator, running through the dead forests.\n\nIndustrializing the Urals is an impossible task, but the few warlords who remain have, somehow, made the best of things. Old Russian equipment has proven its durability many times over, and there exists a class of merchants insane enough to ferry outside guns to the warlords. Although there is no cohesive government or economy in this land, communities strive to maximize their meager industry, ensuring a degree of self-sufficiency.\n\nThe climate, however, is only getting worse. Wildfires are a common sight, and the clouds haven't relented in a long time. Entire generations have been born and died in anarchy, beneath the shadows of the everlasting mountains."

   URA_siberia_burns: "Siberia Burns"
   URA_siberia_burns_desc: "In the Ural Mountains, simple survival is a challenge. Rampant forest fires, unpredictable floods, and roving marauders make life impossible. Those who could, have already fled. Those who remain, they are the dead. All that remains is the fire of the wasteland."
   URA_no_army: "No Army, No State, No Nothing"
   URA_no_army_desc: "The Urals are inhabited by the remnants of Army Group South. Originally a grand Eurasian force sent to reinforce the rapidly deteriorating situation in old Kazakhstan, the entire army routed due to a variety of reasons, including poor supply and low morale. The collapse of the campaign led to most of the army retreating past the Urals. The decentralized government in Eurasia failed to rally the deserters, and instead relied upon the League to stem the inflow of Far Eastern refugees.\n\n But for the people of the Urals, there is nothing left. The villages are reduced to ash, the people empty husks. Once proud-soldiers, now reduced to pillaging. What lies ahead, a dense fog."
