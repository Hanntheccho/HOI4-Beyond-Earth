 greek_event.1.t: "Picking A Side"
 greek_event.1.d: "Following the Great Mistake, Greece has remained relatively isolated from the rest of European affairs. Its main trading partners have been in the Middle East and the Balkan Federation, although Italy’s recent restabilization has also offered lucrative trade. The only major military conflicts initiated by Greece during the 22nd century have been the full occupation of Cyprus following brief skirmishes with the Turkish garrison there, and a successful anti-banditry campaign against Mediterranean pirates.\n\nHowever, with the dawn of the 23rd century, few analysts expect European peace to last forever. Should one of the main alliances prevail over the others, it will surely proceed to roll over the rest of the continent. To ensure continued peace and a potential spot in the Space Race, Greece must align itself with an existing power bloc. However, once an alliance has been chosen, it will be impossible to leave it."
 greek_event_option.1.a: "Send Paris a letter!"
 greek_event_option.1.b: "INTEGR makes a good case."
 greek_event_option.1.c: "Stand by our Orthodox brethren!"
 greek_event_option.1.d: "We need more time to determine the best course of action."
 greek_event.2.t: "Successful Land Reclamation Near Thessaloniki"
 greek_event.2.d: "It’s hard to know what’s true in this new, modern world, especially when all information is distributed by governments, and is shared at regional levels at best. Greece is no exception - all information about topics such as history, politics, and news around the world exists only in the form of datalinks, and, according to them, Greece is undoubtedly the greatest of all Balkan countries, maybe even number one in the whole world. Its wise leadership has led it through tumultuous centuries into a golden age, and even though the Great Mistake hit nations relying on sea trade and vast shores the hardest, it is still going strong, and reclaiming lost territories at an unbelievably fast pace! Some scholars heavily doubt and even deny this version of events, with many foreign media outlets questioning their authenticity. Historical revision and idealised outlooks have become the norm in Greece."
 greek_event_option.2.a: "What you don’t know can’t hurt you"
 greek_event.3.t: "Hellenic Revisionism"
 greek_event.3.d: "Climate change in the last centuries has affected all of the world, with rising sea levels taking over coasts, farmlands, and entire cities. Thessaloniki was one of the affected regions, with outer borders of it turning into wetlands. Greece's government efforts of draining the water there were successful. All of the affected land was successfully reclaimed, and ready for construction and resettlement."
 greek_event_option.3.a: "Exochos!"

 GRE_heart_of_old_athens: "Heart Of Old Athens"
 GRE_heart_of_old_athens_desc: "Greece is home to one of the oldest civilizations on the European continent. Its people are the proud owners of a rich history that spans entire millenniums. The ruins of long dead rulers overshadow the modern network nodes and high-tech construction facilities. Schools teach ancient history alongside augmentation, and whatever small tourism industry still exists in Europe has been virtually monopolized by Greece. The mountainous terrain of this nation has also allowed it to survive the floods of water and refugees, leaving it in a position of relative strength."
