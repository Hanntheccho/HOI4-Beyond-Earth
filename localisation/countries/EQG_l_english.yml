 EQG_nwabudike_morgan: "Nwabudike Morgan"
 EQG_nwabudike_morgan_desc: "Nwabudike Morgan is a self-confident, even arrogant individual. To him, life is a game of status measured by economic success, and he loves that game for its own sake. He has few ethical values beyond the acquisition of wealth, although he does believe in the fulfillment of contracts. Thus, once he gives his word, it can be relied on. He believes that any interaction can be controlled if the right inducements (money, affection, the threat of harm) can be brought to the table. As a leader, he portrays himself as an affable businessman, willing to work for anyone - but make no mistake: in the end he intends to move from merchant prince to emperor.\n\nBorn in 2145 to an old noble family tied to royalty in former Nigeria, Nwabudike Morgan built a world-class business empire from the ground up. Seed money from his family went to buying and selling weapons during the collapse of the African Union. Profits from that venture backed a mercenary force that aided the nascent Biafran government during the breakup of Nigera and gave Morgan control of many of Biafra's key industries. From there he diversified, leveraging his growing wealth to expand into several other businesses. By the early 2190s, he had a vast empire that included mercenary forces, media outlets, agribusinesses and food-transport corporations, brokering food deals, and creating Morgan SafeHaven Hotel Fortress chain for the discriminating executive.\n\nNot all ventures have been so successful. An eager attempt to enter into the fledgling Sokoto market proved severely misjudged, with the pro-Morgan government ultimately overthrown by a motley coalition of eco-Islamist communalists. With subsequent attempts at an outright hostile takeover ending in defeat, Morgan now faces considerable pressure from his shareholders. Morgan Industries' expansions into Benin and Adamawa fall under increasing public scrutiny, with nationalistic elements fearful of what will become of their countries under Morgan's growing influence. Something will have to give, and the shareholders will want their cut regardless of the outcome."

 EQG_morgan_industries_modifier: "Morgan Industries"
 EQG_morgan_industries_modifier_desc: "Human behavior is economic behavior. The particulars may vary but competition for limited resources remains a constant. Need as well as greed have long driven us, and the rewards of wealth still await those wise enough to recognize this deep thrumming of our common pulse. Africa now stirs from its malaise, eager to seize the opportunities of a post-Mistake world."
 EQG_morgan_security_modifier: "Morgan Security"
 EQG_morgan_security_modifier_desc: "Morgan Security is the pride of our company, easily rivalling the police and even armies of many African nations. Unfortunately, this has come at a cost. Many of our forces consist of mercenaries on our payroll, resulting in a severe lack of discipline and mismatch in equipment. While we have made some effort to standardise, more will need to be done to fully realise Morgan Security to its full potential."

 EQG_a_corporation_with_a_country_desc: "Through shrewd negotiations and the filling of gaps left by inadequate public services, Morgan Industries has become the dominant political force in Biafra and its neighbors - so much so that many now openly question the need for national government. It has become a topic of considerable debate, not least of all within Morgan Industry's boardroom. With the failure of incorporating Sokoto still looming large, all eyes are now on Benin to see whether our dream of an Africa freed from stifling governments will become a reality or if it was a doomed endeavour from the start."

 EQG_biafra_a_morgan_industries_company: "Biafra, A Morgan Industries Company"
 EQG_biafra_a_morgan_industries_company_desc: "We have never sought to become a monopoly. Our products are simply so good that no one feels the need to compete with us. That includes includes services once solely the realm of the government. But through our ambitious work in Biafra, at last it is time for the transition from megacorporation to government, from entrepreneur to emperor. It is now that the true genius of our strategy shall become apparent!"
 EQG_the_benin_project: "The Benin Project"
 EQG_the_benin_project_desc: "Ah, Benin. Our dear neighbor once found itself in a similar state to ours - languishing under an ineffectual government, the victim of a failure to capitalise on its own people and resources. Fortunately, they have us to give them a second chance. We've already bought out their major state-owned enterprises and many of the tentpole private sector ones as well. But most importantly, Benin represents our biggest foray outside of Biafra since our failed attempt at incorporating Sokoto. If we can pull it off this time, then we will have the resources to begin looking even further afield."
 EQG_morgans_proposal: "Morgan's Proposal"
 EQG_morgans_proposal_desc: "As much as I appreciate T.M.'s input on the project, we will stand by our original plan. Yes, we will take his criticisms into account to better smooth over the transition and ensure the accessibility of services. But keeping Benin groaning under the weight of an overbearing and ineffectual government is unwarranted."
 EQG_cut_out_the_middlemen: "Cut Out the Middlemen"
 EQG_cut_out_the_middlemen_desc: "There is nothing the government of Benin offers its people that we cannot do better. Freed from the burden of unnecessary regulation, we will jumpstart their economy and put them back on the road to prosperity. At least once we finish putting down the riots."
 EQG_morgan_reillys_proposal: "Morgan-Reilly's Proposal"
 EQG_morgan_reillys_proposal_desc: "Ah, T.M.! My favorite nephew. An idealistic young man, but I try not to fault him for it. He is the embodiment of a new generation of Africans - ambitious and innovative, but not ignorant to the plight of those around him. Perhaps more than I would consider healthy, especially in his desire to see obsolete national governments propped up to dispense handouts. But he makes enough of a case for himself to be humored."
 EQG_assure_the_people: "Assure the People"
 EQG_assure_the_people_desc: "We never planned to leave the people of Benin high and dry, but many have been slow to trust our message. Seeing their government and its services remain in place will make our presence in Benin more complicated, but the public reception of the move has been positive enough to make it a tolerable move."
 EQG_sealing_accounts: "Sealing the Deal"
 EQG_sealing_accounts_desc: "Our boardroom has given a collective sigh of relief at the latest news from Benin. Their government - or what little will remain of it - has been incorporated as part of our operations. Some of the people have taken to the news poorly, but Morgan Security now has an excellent opportunity to show off its latest riot control solutions."
 EQG_a_rebranding: "A Rebranding"
 EQG_a_rebranding_desc: "With Morgan Industries now poised to incorporate both Biafra and Benin as direct elements of its operation, we are faced with the challenge of how we go about it. Never before has a private company been in such a position, and we must make full use of it to see our vision realised."

 EQG_morgan_consutruction: "Morgan Construction"
 EQG_morgan_consutruction_desc: "Construction is the foundational bedrock of civilisation, whether it be the humblest of houses to the cutting-edge infrastructure. But with so many buildings destroyed or fallen into disrepair in the post-Mistake world, our construction division has its work cut out for it."
 EQG_new_prefab_designs: "New Prefab Designs"
 EQG_new_prefab_designs_desc: "Between the Great Mistake and the collapse of the African Union, West Africa has lost much of its infrastructure. This makes it a useful testbed for new prefabricated designs, ensuring that they are up to the challenges of post-Mistake conditions and demand. Even if they're not... well, at least they're cheap and easy to build."
 EQG_hire_flood_barrier_specialists: "Hire Flood Barrier Specialists"
 EQG_hire_flood_barrier_specialists_desc: "The oceans have already stolen enough productive land from us. The last thing we need now are flooding rivers and coastal storm surges wiping out even more useful infrastructure. Fortunately, West Africa has developed a surprisingly robust land reclamation industry. It should be easy to poach the best of its talent - we pay more than Bamako, after all!"
 EQG_morgan_safehaven_hotel_fortresses: "Morgan SafeHaven Hotel Fortresses"
 EQG_morgan_safehaven_hotel_fortresses_desc: "Business travel has become unsettlingly dangerous in the modern era. That's why smart executives use Morgan SafeHaven Hotel Fortresses! All the comfort of a world-class hotel, with the security of a small military base. In fact, they're so well-fortified that they make for good staging points for our mercenaries. Just as long as we make them pay for their own room service."
 EQG_morgan_civil: "Morgan Civil"
 EQG_morgan_civil_desc: "We have always strived to demonstrate that the private sector is a powerhouse of innovation and development, more so than any corrupt and inefficient government. But that does not mean we turn a blind eye to the basic services that keep a country running. Quite the opposite: Morgan Civil is a world leader in civil engineering and services, providing critical solutions in a world where even the basics are no longer a guarantee. Our opponents may slander us, but we understand that it is in our best interest to keep society functioning. Otherwise, our wealth would be meaningless!"
 EQG_improve_insurance_coverage: "Improve Insurance Coverage"
 EQG_improve_insurance_coverage_desc: "An ill worker is an unproductive worker. That is why our company insurance policies should cover as broad a range of treatment as possible, made affordable at any MorganCare clinic. Private rooms will be available at a premium, naturally."
 EQG_expand_scholarship_programs: "Expand Scholarship Programs"
 EQG_expand_scholarship_programs_desc: "We have no need for dumb workers or dimwitted managers. Let's expand our scholarship program to even more bright young minds, so that they might realise their aspirations. On the condition they do so in a Morgan subsidiary after graduating; it's only fair we see a return on our investment."
 EQG_invest_in_infrastructure: "Invest in Infrastructure"
 EQG_invest_in_infrastructure_desc: "West Africa is studded with heat-cracked roads, abandoned railways and a general dearth of reliable infrastructure. It's a detriment to our operations, and a detriment to its people. Investing more on those basics gives us a firmer foundation to base our activities on."
 EQG_morgan_heavy_industries: "Morgan Heavy Industries"
 EQG_morgan_heavy_industries_desc: "We can't expect to maintain a functioning economy without a steady stream of resources. New extraction and recycling methods will go a long way towards that, but Biafra only holds a limited amount of resources we can draw on. We will need to expand further, and soon."
 EQG_survey_deposits: "Survey Deposits"
 EQG_survey_deposits_desc: "Resources exist to be consumed, and consumed they will be... provided we can find the damned things! Fortunately, Africa is still rich in untapped wealth, ripe for the picking for those tenacious enough. Let us take what is ours, chew and eat our fill."
 EQG_overhaul_factories: "Overhaul Factories"
 EQG_overhaul_factories_desc: "Our ability to produce useful goods is the cornerstone of our society. With widespread de-industrialisation following the Great Mistake and later the collapse of the African Union, we've only just managed to claw back some degree of meaningful industrial base. But it is not enough. We need more factories, and we need them now."
 EQG_waste_reclamation_subsidies: "Waste Reclamation Subsidies"
 EQG_waste_reclamation_subsidies_desc: "Just because we are re-industrialising West Africa doesn't mean we should be content to wallow in our filth. Certainly not when that filth can be used to make new products. Let us kill two birds with one stone by creating a (slightly) cleaner economy, and gather even more raw materials in the process."
 EQG_morgan_rnd: "Morgan R&D"
 EQG_morgan_rnd_desc: "To stagnate is to be left behind in this competitive world of ours. That's why we maintain a robust research and development unit, keeping us one step ahead in an ever-changing world."
 EQG_test_subjects_wanted_apply_now: "Test Subjects Wanted: Apply Now!"
 EQG_test_subjects_wanted_apply_now_desc: "Our scientific efforts are always in need of new test subjects, especially for vital medical and weapons testing. Immoral? Not when we're paying them (or their next of kin) for their services!"
 EQG_research_grants: "Research Grants"
 EQG_research_grants_desc: "Wealth is the universe's way of rewarding those who are clever and efficient. Those who scorn it are turning their backs on the imperatives of life. Instead, let's embrace them, pressing ourselves for new and innovative ways of doing business and improving life."
 EQG_lab_to_market_pipeline: "Lab-to-Market Pipeline"
 EQG_lab_to_market_pipeline_desc: "Ivory tower intellectuals must not lose touch with the world of industrial growth and hard currency. It is all very well and good to pursue high-minded scientific theories, but research grants are expensive and must justify their existence by providing not only knowledge, but concrete and profitable applications as well."
 EQG_morgan_media: "Morgan Media"
 EQG_morgan_media_desc: "Morgan Media has long been a staple of our operations, covering everything from mass communication to publishing. Its main focus, however, is informational. It prides itself on being an impartial source of unbiased information, highlighting how wonderful our contributions to Africa are and how much better off people will be with our business. That is, after all, the truth."
 EQG_morgan_tv_presents_morgan_link: "MorganTV Presents: MorganLink!"
 EQG_morgan_tv_presents_morgan_link_desc: "It's a shame that the internet of old met such an ignoble fate, but we can learn much from the impact it had on the economy. Let's take those lessons to the internet's diminutive cousin, the datalinks. While it is far more regional and less versatile, it still represents a brave new frontier for our media offerings. We would be foolish not to embrace it."
 EQG_network_node_subsidies: "Network Node Subsidies"
 EQG_network_node_subsidies_desc: "Every community deserves access to a network node and the economic opportunities of the datalinks. That's why we're going to subsidise the construction of new network nodes for unconnected settlements. Of course, we'll bundle our MorganNet software with the new nodes - our customers expect no less of us!"
 EQG_elevate_new_talent: "Elevate New Talent"
 EQG_elevate_new_talent_desc: "As our influence grows, we bring with us a dream of a new, prosperous Africa. Already, artists of all stripes are inspired by our efforts, creating a new generation of cultural works inspired by our values. By giving them a voice and some patronage, we'll ensure that they reach the widest audience possible."
 EQG_morgan_agriculture: "Morgan Agriculture"
 EQG_morgan_agriculture_desc: "Everyone has to eat, but not everyone can as much as they might need or want. This leaves an untapped market ready for our food products. From innovative new farming practices to reliable outlets for foodstuffs,our agribusiness unit is only too happy to cater to this market - literally!"
 EQG_buy_out_farms: "Buy Out Farms"
 EQG_buy_out_farms_desc: "Independent farms are a tremendous waste of potential. Little capital, limited technology and high vulnerability to extreme weather mean it's a miracle these dirt farmers don't end up starving the rest of us to death! Let's not take chances. Let them name their price, and we'll put their land to better use with the latest supercrop biostrains and multipurpose autotractors. They won't even need to get up early to milk the neo-cows."
 EQG_drought_resistant_crop_patents: "Drought-Resistant Crop Patents"
 EQG_drought_resistant_crop_patents_desc: "The world is in poor shape. Famine reaps a bloody bounty across the globe, not least of all where drought hits the hardest. Our latest line of drought-resistant crops aims to change that. Able to survive even the driest conditions, they will fill our coffers while filling bellies in the process!"
 EQG_market_insect_protein: "Market Insect Protein"
 EQG_market_insect_protein_desc: "While many are revulsed by the idea of eating insects, there's no denying that they are a highly efficient source of protein - infinitely more so than traditional meat. With proper marketing and preparation into palatable forms, insect protein is easily the food of the future. Our focus groups particularly enjoyed the fried and salted maggots. Here, try one!"

 EQG_opportunities_abroad: "Opportunities Abroad"
 EQG_opportunities_abroad_desc: "The great do not settle for sufficiency. We have a genuine opportunity to build a bright new future not just for Benin and Biafra, but for the whole of Africa. But that will not come if we content ourselves with our current territory. We will need to expand further, gathering new resources and support, lest we allow Africa to continue to languish in poverty under parasitic governments."
 EQG_morgan_security: "Morgan Security"
 EQG_morgan_security_desc: "Morgan Security is a rather euphemistic title, considering that the bulk of its manpower are disparate mercenary forces more loyal to their next paycheck than to our cause. Unless we want them to defect as soon as they get a better offer, we must begin to fully integrate them into our ranks as professional military contractors. Sweetening their deal wouldn't hurt, either."
 EQG_north_african_security: "North African Security"
 EQG_north_african_security_desc: "While not as immediate a threat as our opponents in West and Southern Africa, North Africa cannot be ignored. Our rivals are making strong headway bringing North African nations to their cause, particularly as they approach the Republic of Egypt's burgeoning sphere of influence."
 EQG_tender_aerospace_contractors: "Tender Aerospace Contractors"
 EQG_tender_aerospace_contractors_desc: "Moving into North Africa, our ground forces risk getting bogged down in the inhospitable wasteland of the Sahara, the flood-prone banks of the Nile or the countless urban sprawls that have sprung up around Africa's cities. Thus, the need for air superiority has never been greater. Our forces are in need of greater mobility, not to mention protection against enemy aircraft. While West Africa's aircraft industry is far from the largest, it has enough in the way of domestic manufacturers that we can spur them into expanding our air force."
 EQG_hire_uniform_stylists: "Hire Uniform Stylists"
 EQG_hire_uniform_stylists_desc: "Given that mercenaries form a sizeable portion of our forces, their sense of fashion can be a bit... eclectic. Normally that wouldn't be worth dealing with, but it is becoming clear that we will need to begin accounting for a wider range of combat environments than they are used to. Bringing in a panel of experts will help us design uniforms better suited to dangerous climates, not to mention better represent the company image."
 EQG_north_african_reconstruction_fonds: "North African Reconstruction Fund"
 EQG_north_african_reconstruction_fonds_desc: "With the fighting in North Africa dying down, it's time to be good corporate citizens and help repair some of the damage we may have accidentally caused. Or, at least, fix it at a discount."
 EQG_west_african_security: "West African Security"
 EQG_west_african_security_desc: "Our position in West Africa is a more tenuous one than most would admit. While we had little love of the African Union, its death brought out all manner of bandits and warlords eager to seize a piece of its corpse. And with Sokoto sharpening its fangs to our north and the Bamako Compact ascendant in the west, we'll soon have even more sophisticated foes bearing down on us."
 EQG_threat_profile_sokoto: "Threat Profile: Sokoto"
 EQG_threat_profile_sokoto_desc: "Sokoto marks an early attempt to expand our operations, and one we would rather forget. Following a vicious rebellion that slaughtered our friendly regime, the nation has been taken over by tree-hugging Islamists more interested in sitting in the dirt praying than rebuilding Africa. That would be bad enough if they weren't still out for revenge, meaning that we'll soon be in dire need of more manpower. Good thing West Africa is full of desperate people willing to die for good pay."
 EQG_threat_profile_bamako: "Threat Profile: Bamako"
 EQG_threat_profile_bamako_desc: "The Bamako Compact is an unexpected side effect of the African Union's collapse. With the region facing severe flooding and desertification, the Mali Federation drew together under an executive council espousing pie-in-the-sky ideas about ecological engineering and human augmentation. While we are broadly supportive of such technologies, an exclusive club of ivory tower intellectuals is hardly the best option for bringing it about. Certainly not when they've already made it clear that they think we're a threat to their plans. We'll need to up our recruiting efforts, lest they move against us before we move against them."
 EQG_west_african_reconstruction_fonds: "North African Reconstruction Fund"
 EQG_west_african_reconstruction_fonds_desc: "Whether it be a launching point for the rest of our operations or as the base of future entries into the European and American markets, West Africa will prove a geographically important region for a long time to come. Let's clean it up a bit to make sure it's up to the task."
 EQG_south_african_security: "Southern African Security"
 EQG_south_african_security_desc: "We will find few friends in Southern Africa. The Kimpwanza League may enjoy its freedoms, but it holds enough anti-corporate attitudes to wave off our diplomacy. And then there's the East African Federation, who are too socialistic to even consider approaching.

 EQG_the_adamawa_portfolio_desc: "Adamawa has been devastated by the triple-whammy of the Great Mistake, the breakup of Nigeria and Cameroon, and the collapse of the African Union. Despite a brief rally as it established nationhood, it quickly fell into famine and downturn. Our involvement in the area has brought much-needed stability and opportunity, though not all are happy with the arrangement. Namely those who don't own the land.

 EQG_meet_with_local_leaders_desc: "T.M. has agreed to hold a conference with local leaders who have spoken out against Morgan Industries.

Hopefully he can talk some sense into the Adamawans, and ensure that we reach a deal that satisfies everyone sufficiently."
 EQG_mutual_compromise: "Mutual Compromise"
 EQG_mutual_compromise_desc: "Well, I have to hand it T.M.: he appears to have hashed out a deal with the Adamawans. I have my criticisms, and the shareholders don't like it at all, but it's being hailed by the Adamawans as a breakthrough. With Morgan Industries suddenly having a second chance in the region, I say we seize it.

 EQG_adamawa_land_of_opportunity_desc: "Adamawa is emerging as a beacon of African prosperity, where fair dealings has brought an equitable and... whatever, I'll leave the spiel to Marketing. The important thing is that the Adamawans are happy, and that we're still making a decent profit working with them. While the specifics are debatable, there is no denying the end result.

 EQG_the_big_question_desc: "Morgan. A name that will go down in history. Our company has resided over the unification of Africa, bringing them together in a common vision of stability and prosperity that will overcome the challenges of the post-Mistake world. It calls for some much needed celebration, and perhaps some reflection on our choices."
 EQG_africa_a_morgan_industries_company: "Africa, A Morgan Industries Company"
 EQG_africa_a_morgan_industries_company_desc: "We have proven once and for all that Africa does not need meddlesome governments to determine its fate.

 morganindustries.1.t: "A Private Public Sector"
 morganindustries.1.d: "Another day, another packed schedule. Meetings in the morning. Committees in the afternoon. Even mealtimes were formal affairs to be shared with important representatives. But Nwabudike Morgan would have it no other way; being busy meant that his work was bearing fruit.\n\nThat particular day had him oversee the opening a new maglev hub in Kano. The old railway station had been a barely-functional mess, left underfunded and overused by the Biafran government's state-run transportation corporation. But that old fossil of a so-called business was long gone, subsumed into Morgan Industries' burgeoning portfolio. Soon enough, the Biafran government itself would meet that same fate. Nwabudike couldn't wait to see the day.\n\nHe could see his triumph in the workers' eyes as he shook their hands. They were genuinely happy to meet him. Many had been left unemployed by the economic downturn that followed the African Union's collapse, though it wasn't as if the economy had been booming beforehand. Where the nations of West Africa weren't stifled under oppressive governments, they'd been terrorised at the hands of warlords. But now, he offered a new path. The determination of the private sector, and the respectful integrity of a competitive business. All coming together to offer Africa something it hadn't seen since the world economy fell: opportunity.\n\nThe protests at the gates did put a damper on things. They weren't even protesting the project itself - just Morgan Industries as a whole. Whether they were nostalgic nationalists who somehow saw something in their trainwreck of a government or treehuggers discontent that humanity was fighting back against nature's brutality, he didn't care. A few whispered demands into the ear of his security detachments, a few gunshots, and silence fell. Even among the workers.\n\n'Ah, don't give me that look!' Morgan said to them with his brightest smile. 'Just a few warning shots!'\n\nIt was true, after all. The workers chuckled awkwardly, clearly unwilling to question the man whose name appeared on their paychecks. They instead continued their tour, from the freight terminal that would soon be filled with Morgan goods to the passenger platforms that awaited Morgan worker. Alone, it was an impressive engineering achievement. But taking a strategic lens, it was a vital cog in the Morgan Industries machine."
 morganindustries.1.a: "And that machine would bring the rebirth of Africa, while making a fortune in the process."
 morganindustries.2.t: "Between a Rock and a Hard Place"
 morganindustries.2.d: "Biafra had been fortunate, in many ways. West Africa had suffered some of the continent's worst damage from the Great Mistake, with the ineffectual African Union floundering in its attempts to preserve order. It certainly wasn't enough to prevent the breakup of many nations, including Nigeria. Biafra was quick to organise, not least of all in thanks to Morgan Industries' own efforts. Within a decade, it had emerged as a beacon of comparative stability in the region. But that same success had not been shared elsewhere.\n\nSokoto had been an early interest of Morgan's. It too had formed from Nigeria's ashes, incorporating a few statelets that survived the collapse of Niger and Chad in the process. Poverty and violence ran rife, and the young government proved utterly incapable of maintaining order. In the end, the nation came to resemble a collection of survivalist communities more than a functional nation. Seeing immense opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal with Biafra's northern neighbor, Morgan Industries began making overtures to the government of Sokoto. But like in so many other nations, the will of the people did not match the government that claimed to represent them. And the response was utterly blindsiding.\n\nThe Sokoto Revolt was spearheaded by strange bedfellows in the form of Islamists and communalists, united in their ecological ideals and anti-corporate rhetoric. The government was overthrown, and Morgan Industries' envoys were only spared to prevent retaliation. Which wasn't enough to stop Morgan, of course, but subsequent attempts by Morgan Security to move into the area were met with surprisingly fierce partisan resistance. It was only then that further incursion was discouraged - after all, it was no longer profitable.\n\nThere are now genuine fears that history will repeat in Benin. While it celebrated total victory in the Benin-Togo War, Benin has remained a deeply impoverished and underdeveloped state that quickly declined further into post-war downturn. It was then that Morgan swooped in with generous reconstruction packages, beginning a slow but cautious campaign to ingratiate itself with Benin. The influx of capital saw Benin bloom like never before, even if some grumbled about their land being controlled by Biafrans and the loss of a few pieces of nature. And even then, that's after providing far more concessions than we might once have.\n\nThe negotiations for the incorporation of Benin near a critical stage. Morgan Industries' influence over the nation grew absolute, from the hearts and minds of its people to the wallets of its increasingly ineffectual government. But the shadow of Sokoto looms large. Failure in Benin could put Morgan Industries' more recent moves into Adamawa into jeopardy, or even threaten its grip over Biafra. If the dream of a prosperous Africa was to be realised, Morgan Industries would need to expand."
 morganindustries.2.a: "Even if it came at great cost, or even greater sacrifice."
 morganindustries.3.t: "Thicker Than Water"
 morganindustries.3.d: "Ah, if it isn't my favorite nephew!' Nwabudike said, drawing the young man into an embrace. 'You're looking well, T.M.! How's the better half?'\n\nTejumola-Maduka chuckled lightly. 'She's well. She and her friends are vacationing in Souza, on the beach. I'd have gone too if it wasn't for my work in Benin.'\n\nNwabudike wasn't surprised to hear it. T.M. was dedicated to a fault, especially in agreeing to marry into the Reilly Heavy Industries fortune. The young lad was a beloved public figure, too. Very busy on the philanthropic scene, and increasingly the political. Nwabudike had his cynicisms on that front, but there was no denying his progress in Benin.\n\n'Such as it is, sometimes. But it will pay off, I'm sure.' Nwabudike led T.M. deeper into his penthouse, over to the well-stocked minibar. 'Come, have a drink. Cool off from the heat. Tell me, how did your trip to Benin go? Any luck with the negotiations?'\n\nT.M. sighed, quickly accepting a cold glass of zobo. 'Some. We're facing grave concerns about the handover of public services. Health especially. So many are already left behind already, there's no way they could afford our private clinics.'\n\nNwabudike sighed. 'Nothing in this world comes for free, T.M.. Medicine does not pay for itself.'\n\n'And leaving the ill to suffer will not help our cause. It won't help our workers when they fall ill. I believe that we need to allow the Biafran government to continue functioning in some capacity. That'd help with the healthcare a bit, and would address the nationalist backlash...'\n\nNwabudike sighed, bracing himself for another debate. It wasn't the first time they'd broached the topic, be it about Benin, Adamawa or even Biafra itself. T.M. was prepared to sacrifice wealth and power that few in Morgan Industries' upper management would appreciate, all in pursuit of outdated ideals. It was unfortunate that some will be left behind in the pursuit of progress, yes. To bog it down with handouts to those who haven't earned their keep would normally be a laughable idea. But Nwabudike bitterly reminded himself that they needed a breakthrough on the Biafra deal."
 morganindustries.3.a: "And sometimes, the best deals require compromise."
 morganindustries.4.t: "Full Steam Ahead"
 morganindustries.4.d: "Human behavior is economic behavior. Long has that been the adage of Nwabudike Morgan, and a popular soundbite of his supporters. There was plenty to criticise about Morgan's ideology, both in the sense of Nwabudike himself and the company he founded. They were firm in their belief of the power of capital, and its ability to harness human ingenuity and determination to overcome obstacles. Mistakes had been made along the way, certainly, but any businessman could tell you that learning from mistakes is a crucial part of doing business.\n\nBut T.M. was not content with that. As a wealthy scion, he'd been blessed with an education that even Morgan Stellartots couldn't provide. That included seeing full well the history of what Africa and the wider world had been through. Men with the same drive and beliefs as Morgan had laid the world to ruin, from the excesses of pollution to the exploitation of Africa's people. The failed seizure of Sokoto had proven that a repeat of history was not only possible, but likely to end with violence.\n\nIn the end, however, T.M. was but a young man - influential, but not even a member of the board. Even then, Nwabudike's word was all but absolute within company affairs. He was firm in his belief that Morgan Industries was all that Africa needed, at least providing a basic framework for an anarcho-capitalistic society. There would be challenges in accomplishing it, but no great businessman would let such trifles stand between him and greatness.\n\nIt was Morgan's success in Benin that cemented the power of his vision. There had been much talk - and even more marketing - in Biafra that Morgan Industries and its subsidiaries were all the state that the people needed. Those claims had been thoroughly vindicated, with talks already underway with the Biafran government to dissolve."
 morganindustries.4.a: "It was surprisingly easy to bring the politicians around, with the right price."
 morganindustries.5.t: "Incorporation"
 morganindustries.5.d: "It was remarkably difficult to maintain a luxurious lifestyle in a backwards country during a ruined age. Industry was still a novelty to many Biafrans, and the local luxury goods industry was very much an emergent one. But Nwabudike made do with what he could, even if it meant having to save his preciously small wine collection for truly special occasions. Success in Benin more than qualified.\n\nMorgan Industries' ability to project power had been proven conclusively, even after the failure that was Sokoto. And it had come without compromising on its vision for an Africa freed from parasitic governments and suffocating regulation. There would only be the drive of capital and the humble determination of labor, united in common cause for a better life. There'd be disagreements and issues along the way, of course. But in the end, life was a neverending series of transactions. Everything had a cost, and there'd be someone willing to work for it.\n\n'Now, don't get me wrong,' Nwabudike said, pouring himself and T.M. another glass. 'I admire your concern for the people of Benin. But their best option for a future comes by fuelling the fires of their economy. Their government would only have interfered. Besides, it's not like it was taking good care of them before that, was it?'\n\nT.M. sighed. 'Uncle, I still don't see this working. The riots show no sign of slowing down. Morgan Security's actions have only galvanized them. We're sitting on a powderkeg.'\n\n'Powderkeg? My boy, we are the driving force behind Biafra and Benin's revival! We have the capability to bring that prosperity to all of West Africa, if not further! That is the recipe for stability in the region. Not shortsighted handouts.'\n\n'I know, Uncle. I believe in the company. I truly do. But we need to be working with Africa, not trying to subsume it. Turning it into a place of opportunity, not just an asset.'\n\n'What do you think we've done here in Biafra, T.M.? We've rebuilt this nation from almost nothing. I'm not going to pretend that everyone has prospered equally, but that is a bitter truth of life and it would be naive to think otherwise.'\n\n'And it would be foolish to think that our approach is going to work as flawlessly as you think it will. We've got a larger population than ever, with fewer resources, diminished infrastructure and an overstressed biosphere. Do you think you'll be able to succeed in a world that just might not be able to support it?'\n\n'Yes,' Nwabudike said, without hesitation. 'We have problems, and will face challenges. But so has every successful business. They innovate and they adapt, just like humanity. That is why I say we go forward. I have faith in Africa. In humanity. Capital is the purest form of human ambition, and I intend to leverage it to bring some hope into this half-ruined world of ours. The question is, are you?'\n\nT.M. was silent for a few moments, staring out across the skyline at the glowing streets of Abujo far below the penthouse. 'Very well,' he said at last. 'I'll work with you for now, but I expect to see this vision of yours pay off.'\n\nNwabudike smiled, patting his nephew on the shoulder."
 morganindustries.5.a: "'It most certainly will.'"
 morganindustries.6.t: "Vindication"
 morganindustries.6.d: "Human behavior is economic behavior. Long has that been the adage of Nwabudike Morgan, and a popular soundbite of his supporters. There was plenty to criticise about Morgan's ideology, both in the sense of Nwabudike himself and the company he founded. They were firm in their belief of the power of capital, and its ability to harness human ingenuity and determination to overcome obstacles.

Men with the same drive and beliefs as Morgan had laid the world to ruin, from the excesses of pollution to the exploitation of Africa's people. The failed seizure of Sokoto had proven that a repeat of history was not only possible, but likely to end with violence.\n\nThe African Economic Community was not T.M.'s brainchild, but it was a proposal that he had aligned himself with. It seemed a fair compromise in his eyes; harness the power of the free market to drive the rebuilding of Africa, but tempered with some degree of oversight and a basic social safety net. Many a challenge remained, from sustainability to workers rights, but it was the most viable option he could see given the circumstances. Most importantly, designs for the AEC firmly left Morgan Industries at the head of the table, something likely to temper opposition to it.\n\nIt was T.M.'s success in Benin that put the AEC firmly in the public eye. There had been much talk - and even more marketing - in Biafra that Morgan Industries and its subsidiaries were all the state that the people needed. Those claims now lay in tatters, with many openly questioning whether a new path was needed. The AEC lobby seized the opportunity, and T.M.'s status as the man of the hour suddenly made the once-obscure group a serious force in Morgan Industries' internal politics."
 morganindustries.6.a: "A little help from Uncle Nwabudike helped, too."
 morganindustries.7.t: "Forging a Community"
 morganindustries.7.d: "It was remarkably difficult to maintain a luxurious lifestyle in a backwards country during a ruined age. Industry was still a novelty to many Biafrans, and the local luxury goods industry was very much an emergent one.

Success in Benin more than qualified.\n\nMorgan Industries' ability to project power had been proven conclusively, even after the failure that was Sokoto. Granted, the move had come with unexpected conditions, most still hotly debated by the board of executives. Nwabudike agreed with some, and disagreed with others. But in the end, life was a neverending series of transactions. Everything had a cost, and he was prepared to pay for results.\n\n'I want to make some things absolutely clear,' Nwabudike said, pouring himself and T.M. another glass. 'I am prepared to assist in establishing this Economic Community of yours. Focus group testing shows it to be widely favorable to the public, and I'm all for letting the market decide. But if it comes to fruition, I expect Morgan Industries to sit at the head of the table.'\n\nT.M. sighed. 'Uncle, I'm prepared to allow Morgan Industries to sit among the national representatives. But we're trying to build a bloc of African nations, not a puppet for Morgan Industries' influence.'\n\n'Puppet? My boy, we are the driving force behind Biafra and Benin's revival! We have the capability to bring that prosperity to all of West Africa, if not further! No other government or corporation can make a comparable claim.'\n\n'I know, Uncle. I believe in the company. I truly do. But we need to be working with Africa, not trying to subsume it. Turning it into a place of opportunity, not just an asset.'\n\n'What do you think we've done here in Biafra, T.M.?

Nations have risen and fallen, united and divided, and generally left geographers scrambling to update their maps every other week. Africa saw some of the worst Balkanisation outside of India, with many nations simply no longer existing as they once were. Nigeria and Cameroon were among them, though successors have long since formed in their wake. Adamawa is but one such state, and an impoverished one at that.\n\nMorgan Industries sought to change that. It brought investment and capital, revitalising the nation's agrarian economy into an agricultural powerhouse. Crop yields are up, desertification is on the decline, and starvation rapidly receding. Automation of farm labor did lead to some issues with mass unemployment later on, but the construction of new factories has helped lessen it. But unemployment combined with nationalist sentiment - stoked by the sight of Biafrans coming to dominate the economy - make for a volatile mix. One that has long started to boil over.\n\nIt started out with protests and blockades, but Morgan Security was able to deal with all that easily enough. But all it took was one undisciplined mercenary to spark a massacre, which proved a turning point in Adamawa. Within months, armed ambushes on Morgan facilities and convoys were commonplace. Pro-Morgan politicians have faced assassination, with one such attempt recently succeeding. Public opinion grows polarised; many want Morgan out of their country, but many rely on the company to feed their families.\n\nIntervention is obviously a necessity, but polarisation on the matter has spread to Morgan's own ranks. Many would be perfectly happy sending in Morgan Security to deal with the matter with force. But a sizeable group believes that Morgan Industries' current approach has failed Adamawa, and that a renegotiation of the deal is needed. T.M. Morgan Reilly has stepped forward to head a conference with local leaders and propose a compromise, which hasn't gone down well with everyone. Such a move would inevitably harm our bottom line, but it's ultimately a question whether it would be costlier than ramping up our security presence."
 morganindustries.11.a: "And until we reach a decision, Adamwa bleeds."
 morganindustries.12.t: "Morgan Industries Unites Africa"
 morganindustries.12.d: "Following a period of bloody regional conflict and tense diplomatic talks, Africa has unified under a single leadership. However, in an unexpected turn of events, this comes not at the hands of the East African Federation or the various regional alliances competing against it, but rather a private corporation. Morgan Industries CEO Nwabudike Morgan has announced that the entirety of Africa is now the proprietary property of Morgan Industries, and that the continent is open for business.\n\nThis marks the first time Africa has been remotely united since the African Union of old collapsed several decades ago following the Kongo Crisis - a nativist uprising in the Kongo region that saw the African Union crippled by armed conflict and political upheaval, leading to its isolation from West Africa and its ultimate dissolution. In the Union's wake, Morgan Industries played a crucial role in propping up Biafra - a state that emerged in the breakup of Nigeria - ultimately going on to supplant both the Biafran government and the authorities of several neighboring countries.\n\nMorgan Industries' ascent has not gone unchallenged, and rebels continue to clash against Morgan Security forces. Public opinion remains divided, with some viewing Morgan's drive for wealth as a crucial and refreshingly honest crucial step in bringing prosperity to the neglected corners of the continent. Others dismiss Morgan's claims of economic libertarianism by labelling him an emperor by another name, pointing to numerous atrocities committed in his line of business and the monopoly he now holds over commerce across Africa. But whether for good or ill, Africa now sees a unity of focus and purpose unseen in a generation, and the results remain to be seen."
 morganindustries.12.a: "We really must buy out this news outlet. MorganTV News is far more unbiased to our tremendous accomplishments."
 morganindustries.12.b: "An African monopoly?"
 morganindustries.13.t: "African Economic Community Unites Africa"
 morganindustries.13.d: "Following a period of bloody regional conflict and tense diplomatic talks, the African Economic Community has unified the African continent under its leadership. In the wake of this development, AEC Chairman and Morgan Industries CEO Nwabudike Morgan has announced that the Community now spans the entire continent, and that Africa is now open for business.\n\nThe African Union of old collapsed several decades ago following the Kongo Crisis - a nativist uprising in the Kongo region that saw the African Union crippled by armed conflict and political upheaval, leading to its isolation from West Africa and its ultimate dissolution. In the Union's wake, Morgan Industries played a crucial role in propping up Biafra - a state that emerged in the breakup of Nigeria - ultimately going on to found and sponsor the African Economic Community with its initial formation between Biafra and neighboring Benin.\n\nThis Community now spans the continent, comprising an alliance of independent nations and powerful corporations, leveraging the capital of both to spearhead the rebuilding of Africa. However, many question Morgan's influence over the Community. Some view his for wealth as a crucial and refreshingly honest crucial step in bringing prosperity to the neglected corners of the continent. Others dismiss Morgan's claims of economic libertarianism by labelling him a wannabe emperor, pointing to countless atrocities committed in his line of business and the monopoly he now holds over commerce across Africa. Whether the AEC is able to keep Morgan and his vast commercial empire in check remains to be seen, but Africa now sees a unity of focus and purpose unseen in a generation, and the results remain to be seen."
 morganindustries.13.a: "Human behavior is economic behavior."
 morganindustries.14.t: "The Cost of Doing Business"
 morganindustries.14.d: "Once, Nwabudike would have been proud to call the reconstruction of Biafra his proudest accomplishment. An ailing nation, betrayed by long-dead generations and left to rot by its own leadership, had found its fortunes turned around with hard work, determination and, perhaps, a bit of help from his own enlightened leadership. But all of that paled in comparison to what he'd accomplished in a few short years: bringing that same hope for a prosperous future to the entirety of Africa.\n\nResistance remained fierce. Despite the best efforts of Morgan Security, perhaps it always would. But for most, the initial shock was wearing off. All the average person desired was a chance to build their own lives, just as in any age. If anything, post-Mistake poverty left such a life more desirable than ever. And now, all Africans had the chance to build it for themselves. All with Morgan-branded products, Morgan-funded services and Morgan-owned workplaces. Who needs competition when your products are the best?\n\nThe celebrations among Morgan's leadership was unending. It was only after days of parties and love-ins that Nwabudike got a couple of hours to himself, mostly spent checking his messages while treating himself to a glass of wine. Most of his outstanding correspondences were mere flattery on his triumph, though it was welcome nonetheless. But any sense of ego drained from him when he noticed a message from his chief of security, and its contents left him with a deathly chill.\n\nAdult male matching Morgan-Reilly's genetic profile located deceased among anti-Morgan rebels in Kongo Development Zone. Cause of death ascertained to be bullet wound sustained during attack on Morgan Security patrol. Remains held at local Morgan Remembrances morgue awaiting relocation.\n\nMorgan stared at the screen, utterly numb for the longest time. He wished he could be shocked by the news, but after some of the things T.M. had been saying before his disappearance it just wasn't surprising. T.M.'s little crusade had led him astray, and incapable of realising the greatness of what Morgan Industries was accomplishing. Yes, people would be left behind. Yes, there would be sacrifices. But it was worth it. It was all going to be worth it in the end."
 morganindustries.14.a: "Or so Nwabudike kept telling himself."
 morganindustries.15.t: "The African Business"
 morganindustries.15.d: "Once, Nwabudike would have been proud to call the reconstruction of Biafra his proudest accomplishment. An ailing nation, betrayed by long-dead generations and left to rot by its own leadership, had found its fortunes turned around with hard work, determination and, perhaps, a bit of help from his own enlightened leadership. But all of that paled in comparison to what he'd accomplished in a few short years: bringing that same hope for a prosperous future to the entirety of Africa.\n\nResistance remained strong in some places. Despite the best efforts of Morgan Security, it looked to be that way for a long time. But for most, the initial shock was wearing off. The average African was growing accustomed to the idea of being able to build their own future with hard work and fair dealings. Such a life might have been mythical once, but it was now an everyday reality. While Morgan was very much the powerhouse of Africa's booming economy, it was becoming but the foundation of a new society filled with new and innovative businesses.\n\nThe celebrations among Morgan's leadership was unending. It was only after days of parties and love-ins that Nwabudike got a couple of hours to himself, mostly spent checking his messages while treating himself to a glass of wine. Most of his outstanding correspondences were mere flattery on his triumph, though it was welcome nonetheless. But he paused upon seeing a message from T.M., opening it with a faint sense of dread in his gut.\n\nCongratulations, Uncle. I am proud of what you and the company have accomplished today. I wish you all the best in your work rebuilding Africa. But I think I need some time away. At least until I can see that you truly have the continent's best interests at heart. My flight for Europe leaves soon - will let you know when I arrive safely.\n\nMorgan stared at the screen, giving a small sigh. He'd been hoping to repair the rift between himself and his nephew, but the best they'd managed was to agree to disagree. It was a shame, too - he had been growing increasingly comfortable with the idea of naming T.M. his successor. But perhaps T.M. wasn't ready for that yet. Perhaps neither of them were. For the moment, Nwabudike resolved himself to take his nephew's words to heart, and to give him every opportunity to look back at Morgan Industries' work in Africa with pride."
 morganindustries.15.a: "Nwabudike was certainly proud of its people."
 morganindustries.16.t: "A Dream Tarnished"
 morganindustries.16.d: "The apartment T.M. had settled on was a far cry from his uncle's penthouse. It was luxurious enough, and secured enough to befit a man of his standing, though the main thing was that his wife appreciated the view it commanded of the gardens outside the African Economic Community Forum. It saved him a commute, too. God knows he had enough on his plate without it.\n\nThe African Economic Community faced an uphill battle. Vast swathes of the continent were in need of urgent intervention, be it police action, disaster relief or investment in post-Mistake reconstruction. There was ostensibly to be a process for determining which national and corporate members of the community would be involved, but T.M. already knew the outcome. Morgan Industries would receive the lion's share of the profitable work, leaving the rest for everyone else to pick through.\n\nT.M. leaned back from his desk, rubbing his eyes. He wanted to feel joy at what he'd accomplished. Through a network of willing or collaborator governments, Africa stood more united than it had even in the days of the African Union. Increasingly free from the weight of poverty, Africa was starting down the arduous road to prosperity. But with deeply corrupt oversight bodies and increasingly defunded social programs, it was clear that Morgan Industries was very much the driving force behind the African Economic Community, both politically and ideologically.\n\nThe sound of an incoming message drew his attention back to his computer. It was addressed from his Uncle Nwabudike, who was easily the last person he wanted to hear from. Sighing, T.M. opened the message and read.\n\nT.M.! I've just set down at the airport and am on my way to the local SafeHaven Hotel. Got enough space in your busy schedule for dinner? I'm sure the bureaucrats will survive an evening without your input.\n\nT.M. didn't even need to think about it before he began typing out a polite rejection. He was still trying to arrange some unconditional humanitarian aid to drought-stricken Mboumo, after his last proposal had been hijacked by a MorganCare Premium Aid Package tender. He still had a few cards up his sleeve, but the whole affair just left him feeling so painfully aware of how hollow the African Economic Community truly was."
 morganindustries.16.a: "Perhaps some good would come of it, in the end. But he dared not hope anymore."
 morganindustries.17.t: "A Dream Realised"
 morganindustries.17.d: "The apartment T.M. had settled on was a far cry from his uncle's penthouse. It was luxurious enough, and secured enough to befit a man of his standing, though the main thing was that his wife appreciated the view it commanded of the gardens outside the African Economic Community Forum. It saved him a commute, too. He had enough work ahead of him without it.\n\nThe African Economic Community faced many a challenge. Parts of the continent remained in need of further intervention, be it police action, disaster relief or investment in post-Mistake reconstruction. And for once, it was looking like Morgan Industries wasn't going to be the only one contributing. Various humanitarian initiatives had sprung up as government services or private organisations, while Morgan Industries faced unprecedented competition thanks to antitrust laws and the emergence of all manner of small and medium enterprises.\n\nT.M. leaned back from his desk, rubbing his eyes. Tired at he was, he was floored by what they'd accomplished. Through a network of willing or collaborator governments, Africa stood more united than it had even in the days of the African Union. Increasingly free from the weight of poverty, Africa was starting down the arduous road to prosperity. Morgan's influence remained disproportionate, and perhaps not undeservedly so. But it had so far been kept in check with some hard-won regulation, though keeping and expanding those laws would be a fight that would take many more years.\n\nThe sound of an incoming message drew his attention back to his computer. It was addressed from his Uncle Nwabudike, who was easily the last person he wanted to hear from. Sighing, T.M. opened the message and read.\n\nT.M.! I've just set down at the airport and am on my way over. Can't wait to try that new restaurant you recommended. Might have to buy it out if it makes the cut!\n\nT.M. rolled his eyes, but answered with a short but polite response. He loved his uncle, and was genuinely impressed by the work he'd managed. But some things didn't change. Morgan Industries had a lot to offer Africa, but its CEO had some very different ideas to himself about what would be an acceptable cost in bringing it about. One day they might come to a better understanding, but he wasn't holding his breath."
 morganindustries.17.a: "Then again, he was happy enough to take a night off for dinner with family."
