 HUN_rock_and_hard_place: "The Eagle and the Bear"
 HUN_rock_and_hard_place_desc: "Situated between Ebner's INTEGR and Kozlov's Slavic Federation, Hungary sits at the crossroads of Europe. This has led to increasing social changes in the population, despite government and military efforts."
 HUN_popular_front: "The Popular Front"
 HUN_popular_front_desc: "The Popular Front is a broad coalition consisting of the enviromentalist communalists, conservative eurasanists and futurist transmodernists. While under normal circumstances these factions would be at each others throat, Miklós Háry's brutal military dictatorship has forced these people to set aside their differences for the time being.\n\n§RThe Popular Front will undoubtedly descend into chaos after the military is removed from power!§!"
 HUN_hermit_kingdom: "Ellenségeskedés"
 HUN_hermit_kingdom_desc: ""Ellenségeskedés" is a uniquely Hungarian term coined by writer and activist Harcias Mócs used to describe Hungary's hostility and isolationism towards the outside world. While the state officially conducts limited diplomacy with its neighbours, the political scene and economic sector is completely shut-off for outsiders."
