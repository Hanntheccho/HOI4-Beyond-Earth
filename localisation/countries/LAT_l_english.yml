 baltic_event.1.t: "Ahti's Bad News Day"
 baltic_event.1.d: "The setting sun's golden light filtered through the elegant drapes of the presidential palace. Ahti Keskula rubbed his temples before shutting down his workstation. His planned day had been fairly pleasant: opening a new school, touring an autofactory, meeting the NSA ambassador... but instead he'd had to cancel all of it, just because a bunch of INTEGR rabble rousers had decided to whip up a mob and occupy the Kaunas shipworks! What a disaster. He silently cursed the cowardly corporatist guards that just opened the gates to them instead of doing their jobs. But what was done was done.\n\nHis priority now was ensuring that this didn't threaten the ARK project. A setback at this point would destroy his political career. Investors, engineers, scientists, they all had to be herded like cats to make the dream of New Riga happen. A second chance for the Latvians and a step towards a bright future. He sighed, stood up and moved to the windows, pulling the drapes aside. A handful of people were demonstrating outside the palace. There was always some sort of demonstration going on, but it encouraged him that for once, they seemed to be on his side: Signs calling for the immediate expulsion of the INTEGR "terrorists" from the docks. He considered going out to meet them when someone entered his office.\n\nIt was his chief of staff, Eliisa Valk. "What's happening, Eliisa?" he asked. "I think you'd better sit down for this," she said. He felt his stomach plummet to his knees. If Eliisa said something like this, it was bad. He sat back down at his desk, expecting the worst. "Looks like our lead negotiator thought that they were planning to sabotage the ARK. Force us to abandon the project because it was unsalvageable. He ordered the Public Security Service to go in, immediately." Ahti nodded. He had indeed told the negotiator to ensure that the ARK stayed in one piece.\n\n"They weren't prepared, Ahti. Someone shot at them - or they thought someone did. Twenty INTEGR are dead, three of our guys, and a bunch more are in the ICU." Ahti's shaking hand dropped his glasses. "The ARK?", he asked pleadingly. "ARK's fine, we think," she replied. "Poland's already put out a statement, they're spitting mad. I think we can use this, though. They've crossed the line for good, people have seen them for what they really are. If we move quickly, we can-" Ahti waved her off. "It doesn't matter what we do," he said, feeling tired. "You don't understand. They will exploit this rage to take our independence. They'll call us butchers and butcher our Union for it. The Polish have changed, they won't let this go." He closed his eyes. "Call Scotland. Tell them what happened, everything. And then get on your knees and ask, beg them, for help. Anything." He hadn't seen this coming. And that may well be the Union's fatal mistake. But he was Baltic and Baltics didn't give up so easily."
