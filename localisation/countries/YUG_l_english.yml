  YUG_novite_balkani_plan: "Novite Balkani Plan"
  YUG_novite_balkani_plan_desc: "The Novite Balkani Plan has defined Balkan economic policy for almost 40 years. Drafted by the Bulgarian economist and political theorist Mila Nankova, the plan seeks to maximize real economic growth by encouraging consumer spending and focusing the economy on the production of high-value, specialized goods. Many attribute the Federation's financial success to Nankova, although the Communalists and other radical groups have criticized the plan for neglecting the environment and recolonization of abandoned areas.\n\nWith Mila Nankova's passing in 2189, the plan has gradually been losing favor with the government. Talks are already underway to modify it to accommodate short-term militarization and industrial automation. Both INTEGR and Eurasian advisors have critized the Novite Balkani plan for its harmful externalities, although the Federation hasn't experienced a serious famine since 2137."
  YUG_dual_military_doctrines: "Dual Military Doctrines"
  YUG_dual_military_doctrines_desc: "The Balkan Federation is the proud home of intimidating mountain ranges, vast open plains, sprawling forests and two seas. However, while a diverse geography has helped in training individual soldiers, it has also caused a split in high command thinking. Generals often subscribe to a particular mode of battle, largely depending on which geographic area they had originally been trained in, and push against others for a greater emphasis on that type of combat. The mountaineers stress the importance of air power and Walker divisions, much to the dismay of the armor mobility proponents from the West. Similarly, the naval staff is split between a dominating navy in the Black Sea, or a competitive and cost-efficient Mediterranean fleet. Meanwhile, the air force has been caught in the crossfire. These debates need to be decided upon soon or the military will be too divided to stand up to a future invasion of the country."
  YUG_the_communalists: "The Communalist Threat"
  YUG_the_communalists_desc: "For a couple of years now, polarisation in the Balkans has been echoed around the world, especially on the European continent. The green-socialist coalition, calling itself the "communalists", is campaigning for care for the Earth through a more centralised and less unequal economy. Radical anti-capitalist groups have also joined the coalition in order to end what they see as the reason for the Great Mistake and global warming: capitalism.\n\nOn the other hand, more moderate, conservative and even far-right sectors have joined the polarisation game, especially the less moderate groups. The so-called "National Sovereignty Coalition" believes that the Balkan Federation is being influenced by other powers, especially Germany and its leading initiative, INTEGR. The green coalition is being nurtured by the Initiative, in order to provoke a civil rupture and to be able to intervene in its favour."

  balkan_event.1.t: "The Romanian Delegation"
  balkan_event.1.d: "Romania has been a thorn on our side for quite some time - an obstacle for both Pan-Slavism and Balkan Unification! Of course, they aren't the only ones possessing those two traits, but they are quite weak, and surrounded by us and our allies from almost all sides, with the exception of the Hungarians. This allows us for quite some maneuvering. We essentially have an ability to do as we please with them, removing another roadblock towards our two major objectives. The Romanian regime is a reactionary dictatorship, not possessing much in the way of popularity on the European stage, excluding token support from France, at least for now. The path is clear to enforce our will as we see fit."
