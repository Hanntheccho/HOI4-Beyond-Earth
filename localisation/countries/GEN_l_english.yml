 GEN_23rd_century_dawn: "23rd Century Dawn"
 GEN_23rd_century_dawn_desc: "In ages past, the dawn of a new century might be a symbol of hope. But for many, the arrival of the 23rd century has been met with dread. It has been 120 years since the Great Mistake - a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, pushing the already escalating climate crisis into outright climate catastrophe. While there is a sense that a new normal has emerged, and that humanity may yet learn to survive in this new world, many fear that this is only the calm before the storm."

# # # # # CULTURAL SUBTREE IDEAS # # # # #

 GEN_a_question_of_influence: "A Question of Influence"
 GEN_a_question_of_influence_desc: "The Dark Days placed immense stress on national governments, forcing many to adapt and causing some to collapse altogether. Though we have survived, we find ourselves in a world of turmoil and division. Our national politics must be up to the task if we are to ensure our survival."
 GEN_political_reform: "Political Reform"
 GEN_political_reform_desc: "Our administrative facets are exhibiting high signs of corruption: money disappearing from the treasury, minor officials scheduling backdoor meetings with their bosses, and officers fraternizing with other countries. We should address this issue immediately by running background checks on all administrators in high positions and using artificial intelligence to determine who to keep and who to fire."
 GEN_justice_and_law: "Justice and Law"
 GEN_justice_and_law_desc: "The central artificial intelligence scans have confirmed a dramatic fall in corruption, but there is still much work to do. We can step up our efforts by reorganizing military units, establishing new requirements for administrators, adding transparency to the government and drafting more civilian investigative commissions."
 GEN_cultural_investment: "Cultural Investment"
 GEN_cultural_investment_desc: "During the Dark Ages, our nation’s culture has receded. Foreign influence, cold pragmatism, and constant tribal movements have all damaged overall cohesion between the people. We should remedy this through the extensive use of mass media, reviving the interactive art industry, or giving out more grants to well-accomplished artists."
 GEN_cultural_reform: "Cultural Reform"
 GEN_cultural_reform_desc: "Nothing unites a nation quite like the values that keep it together. We should encourage the flourishing of the arts by building fine arts centers, subsidizing broadcasting companies, creating or improving upon the national film board, using new advances in augmentation and automation to go beyond human limits in the pursuit of the unknown, and encourage patriotism among the many communities of our nation."
 GEN_cultural_revolution: "Cultural Revolution"
 GEN_cultural_revolution_desc: "Looking to the big picture, our culture is more than just our identity. It is our ability to project soft power onto the international stage, affecting our perception and influence among other nations. In these days of heightened international competition and, paradoxically, a growing need for international cooperation, let us invest in our culture with the explicit objective of using it to secure our place in the world."
 GEN_national_sovereignty: "National Sovereignty"
 GEN_national_sovereignty_desc: "As conflicts over resources and ideologies grow increasingly common between and within nations, we must be prepared to assert our sovereignty by force. Our cultural messaging must highlight the need for military readiness, and be backed by programmes to entice and support new recruits."

 GEN_improved_terrain_probes_desc: "Between geographical changes brought about by the Great Mistake and advances in geological technologies such as advanced scanners and cost-effective boreholes, there remain vast mineral deposits beneath our feet that have yet to be developed. We should take stock of what resources remain within our borders and make every effort to extract them."
 GEN_new_terrain_analysis: "New Terrain Analysis"
 GEN_new_terrain_analysis_desc: "Even before the Great Mistake, increasingly large portions of electrical generation came from renewable sources. While generally good for the environment, these sources are nonetheless more dependent upon favorable geography than the fossil fuels they replaced. With improved tools for mapping the geography of our nation, we can readily identify new locations for renewable energy generation."
 GEN_first_phase: "First Phase"
 GEN_first_phase_desc: "No country can run without a stable economic base. We should subsidize local workshops and smoothen business regulations to allow for greater economic growth in the long-run for our country."

 GEN_third_phase_desc: "Our economic development efforts are coming to fruition. Now that the base development level is taken care of, we should take care of urban development."
 GEN_infrastructure_subsidies: "Infrastructure Subsidies"
 GEN_infrastructure_subsidies_desc: "During the Dark Ages, we allowed the infrastructure of the nation to rot away while we were preoccupied with bigger problems. No more - we must divert investment into new transportation, utilities and housing."
 GEN_infrastructure_revitalization: "Infrastructure Revitalization"
 GEN_infrastructure_revitalization_desc: "While it is all well and good to shore up our towns and cities’ old infrastructure and make new additions, we must also dedicate resources to new transportation routes to better connect our cities and lands. The decline in private vehicle ownership and advances in maglev technology means that railways will form a particularly important part of the equation."

 GEN_research_center_modernization: "Research Center Modernization"
 GEN_research_center_modernization_desc: "Our scientists have developed a myriad of groundbreaking theories during the Dark Ages, but unfortunately we have always lacked the funds to test them or put them into practice. We should allot more funding to the laboratories and see what they can come up with."
 GEN_research_center_expansion: "Research Center Expansion"
 GEN_research_center_expansion_desc: "Even after we have tested out pre-existing theories developed during the Dark Ages, progress must not stop. We should purchase complex AIs from foreign markets and integrate them into our computer systems to accelerate the course of human development. Let all other nations be in awe of our scientific breakthroughs!"
 GEN_orbital_studies: "Orbital Studies"
 GEN_orbital_studies_desc: "Better late than never - humanity has fallen far from grace in relation to its progress in space exploration. However, to advance where none has gone before, we must be ready to sacrifice everything. Let our country invest all free assets into new satellites and debris tracking stations to advance our progress on the ISS Unity."
 GEN_joint_space_research: "Joint Space Research"
 GEN_joint_space_research_desc: "To be included among the ranks of the other great nations that are building the Unity, we must prove our worth through the increased contribution of raw materials and processing power. We can also unite our efforts with other nations for increased productivity."
 GEN_horizon_program: "Horizon Program"
 GEN_horizon_program_desc: "We cannot afford to lag behind in the race to colonize other planets. The Inflection Point is approaching fast. If we cannot remain competitive, the Great Filter shall destroy not only us, but the very memory of our existence!"

# # # # # LAND SUBTREE # # # # #

 GEN_land_forces: "Land Forces"
 GEN_land_forces_desc: "Most of our army still uses pre-Mistake and Dark Age equipment. We should initiate a proper modernization effort for our military equipment, subsidizing weapons workshops to incentivise military innovation."
 GEN_land_research: "Land Research"
 GEN_land_research_desc: "Our auxiliary equipment is lacking. Contrary to popular belief, even modern rounds can be stopped with sufficient body armor, and secondary weapons like sidearms are still indispensable for the modern soldier."
 GEN_land_breakthroughs: "Land Breakthroughs"
 GEN_land_breakthroughs_desc: "Despite great advances in point defense systems and a dramatic increase in frontline assets, most wars are still fought on the basis of maneuver. As the country is still recovering from the Dark Ages, it would be prudent to invest in the production of new armored vehicles, especially in emergent categories such as cost-effective rovers and the maneuverable walkers."
 GEN_materiel_industry: "Materiel Industry"
 GEN_materiel_industry_desc: "It would be foolish to assume that modern nation-states can function without a substantial military backbone. But an army runs on its stomach, and we must spend all that we can spare in the name of national defense."
 GEN_army_industry_expansion: "Army Industry Expansion"
 GEN_army_industry_expansion_desc: "Let us further increase military production through the drafting of state-owned workshops and army bases."
 GEN_military_industrial_complex: "Industrial-Military Complex"
 GEN_military_industrial_complex_desc: "The army needs more guns, more auxiliary equipment, more med kits - in summary, more of everything, and fast. We cannot afford to fall behind."
 GEN_land_training: "Land Training"
 GEN_land_training_desc: "Our military still operates with the indirect, air-oriented doctrines of pre-Mistake society. Even worse, peripheral military elements remain loyal to the asymmetric warfare that dominated the Dark Ages. We will need to initiate mass digital exercises to redevelop the army."
 GEN_land_adaptation: "Land Adaptation"
 GEN_land_adaptation_desc: "The military AIs that our nation operates can be used to further develop the young officer core. We can download foreign planning cases to better train the military, and connect our network of military installations to assist with inter-service training and exchange of military theory."

# # # # # AIR SUBTREE # # # # #

 GEN_air_forces: "Air Forces"
 GEN_air_forces_desc: "Modern wars are fought and won in the skies. The ability to indiscriminately bombard enemy supply lines, intercept opposing bombers, and have aerial reconnaissance has never before been as important as it is this century."
 GEN_air_research: "Air Research"
 GEN_air_research_desc: "Thus far, our aircraft have relied on either foreign or outdated design blueprints from the Dark Ages and before the Great Mistake. We should establish a proper academic body for the creation of new craft worthy of this new age."
 GEN_air_breakthroughs: "Air Breakthroughs"
 GEN_air_breakthroughs_desc: "Fighter craft have come a long way since their first combat appearance 300 years ago. Apart from the obvious functions of escorting bombers and intercepting enemy aerial vehicles, fighters can also conduct reconnaissance runs and protect orbital infrastructure. More radical designs have even proposed outfitting fighters with engines capable of carrying them into orbit and around the globe."
 GEN_air_base_foundation: "Air Base Foundation"
 GEN_air_base_foundation_desc: "We cannot utilize our new air forces without proper airports. We should fund aerodrome expansion on the periphery and contract international organizations to plan international flight routes."
 GEN_air_base_expansion: "Air Base Expansion"
 GEN_air_base_expansion_desc: "CAS, or Close Air Support, is a type of aerial craft capable of targeting enemy ground positions such as bunkers and tanks with great accuracy and devastation. Investments into the construction of field airbases can allow CAS aircraft to operate close to frontlines where they are desperately needed."
 GEN_grand_air_shield: "Grand Air Shield"
 GEN_grand_air_shield_desc: "The ability to reach deep into the enemy’s territory and destroy their strategic installations is one that all armies are envious of. A proper fleet of bombers, if supported by fighter escorts and drones, can potentially cripple an enemy’s ability to prosecute wars. Meanwhile, a strong fleet of fighters will ensure that our enemies cannot do the same to us."
 GEN_air_training: "Air Training"
 GEN_air_training_desc: "We should resume air exercises without our own airspace. AI can be used to simulate combat for new pilots while veterans should practice with drone swarms."
 GEN_air_adaptation: "Air Adaptation"

 GEN_naval_forces: "Naval Forces"
 GEN_naval_forces_desc: "In the modern world, a global naval presence is indispensable. We will have to hire foreign sailors and naval officers to train our ship crews in new military doctrines."
 GEN_naval_research: "Naval Research"
 GEN_naval_research_desc: "Our navy is still composed mostly of pre-Mistake boats and conscripted civilian vessels. If we are to become a naval power, we must reorganize our industry to better reflect our great ambitions."
 GEN_naval_breakthroughs: "Naval Breakthroughs"
 GEN_naval_breakthroughs_desc: "Larger warships are very expensive to create, and require many small parts that can only be manufactured in dedicated workshops. We can expand upon existing designs to allow for faster repairs, lower maintenance costs, and better operational capabilities."
 GEN_new_drydocks: "New Drydocks"
 GEN_new_drydocks_desc: "An experienced crew is of no use without a well-built ship. In-land and coastal dockyards can be constructed to be protected from naval attacks and some degree of sea level rise while they focus on the creation of a navy worthy of our great state."
 GEN_drydocks_expansion: "Drydocks Expansion"
 GEN_drydocks_expansion_desc: "It would be unwise to prioritize intercontinental operations if we cannot even defend our own coasts! We should invest in additional naval bases and outposts, both to monitor our waters and to support international operations."
 GEN_rising_tide_project: "Rising Tide Project"
 GEN_rising_tide_project_desc: "Protecting local seas and coasts is insufficient if we want to assert a global presence. We will have to outfit our ships with supplementary equipment and supply vessels to greatly boost their range."
 GEN_naval_training: "Naval Training"
 GEN_naval_training_desc: "In a world wracked by rising sea levels and record-breaking flood events, amphibious military operations are more critical than ever. We must ensure that our entire military, from the marines to our carrier groups, can operate effectively in a world where the line between land and sea is frequently blurred."
 GEN_naval_adaptation: "Naval Adaptation"
 GEN_naval_adaptation_desc: "As we replace our older warships, we can repurpose obsolete vessels for training new generations of sailors. While this has been a tried-and-true strategy for centuries, the addition of artificial intelligence and drone technologies means we can make our naval training exercises more realistic (and thus educational) than ever."

 GEN_naval_effort: "Naval Effort"
 GEN_naval_effort_desc: "In the modern world, a global naval presence is indispensable. We will have to hire foreign sailors and naval officers to train our ship crews in new military doctrines."

 GEN_synergy: "Synergy"
 GEN_synergy_desc: "'Accepting the limitations of birthform betrays a lack of imagination’\n-Graffito within an abandoned city.\n\nSynergy is an accelerationist ideology, believing that humanity must evolve by any means to adapt to its new world. They blame unnecessarily conservative views of genetics / culture for being unable to do what needed to be done to prevent the Great Mistake."
 GEN_national_institute_of_science: "National Institute of Science"
 GEN_national_institute_of_science_desc: "Our greatest minds must converge in a National College. Most pre-Mistake learning institutions went under during the last century, although we still retain a sizable academic core. By utilizing AI and new advances in our understanding of the human mind, we can greatly improve our scientists’ abilities."
 GEN_networked_datalinks: "Networked Datalinks"
 GEN_networked_datalinks_desc: "After the Great Mistake, it was deemed necessary to establish Network Nodes, or isolated computer terminals capable of functioning even in the event of another Kessler Syndrome or mass hacking. However, with new advances in software protection technology, our scientists feel confident in their ability to connect existing nodes without compromising their safety."
 GEN_specialization: "Specialization"
 GEN_specialization_desc: "Some scholars have argued that overspecialization diminishes a person’s ability to adapt. However, when applied on a national scale, the specialization of different persons allows the entire society to be excellent in every single respect. Thus, it is necessary for us to expand education facilities and create a new generation of great thinkers."
 GEN_stealth_actions: "Stealth Actions"
 GEN_stealth_actions_desc: "As we have embraced the freedom of bodily modification, we can now augment our covert agents to suit our needs. Specialized probe teams enhanced with bionic limbs and new eyes will be used to infiltrate enemy bases while defensive AIs will counter hackers and raiders."
 GEN_adaptive_sciences: "Adaptive Sciences"
 GEN_adaptive_sciences_desc: "We must focus on quality to better emulate our ambitious goals. However, first, we must ensure that our armies and civilian life are capable of conserving existing assets so we can focus everything on modernized developments."
 GEN_survival_doctrines: "Survival Doctrines"
 GEN_survival_doctrines_desc: "This new world we find ourselves living in is both dangerous and demanding. We must be prepared to sacrifice everything, and more, to survive. Our people must be trained in scavenging, recycling, and self-sustenance methods. To better reflect this philosophy in the military, our units must know how to endure through anything, at any cost."
 GEN_extensive_augmentation: "Extensive Augmentation"
 GEN_extensive_augmentation_desc: "There is nothing to fear in technology. What has been given to us in our birthform may be cast aside if it has become obsolete. There is much of our existence that is unsavory, yet humanity now has the power to transcend beyond itself. We cannot remain idle while the world runs away. We have to chase after it."
 GEN_transhumanism: "Transhumanism"
 GEN_transhumanism_desc: "Our very culture must be reshaped in accordance to the principles of bodily progress, freedom of autonomous thought, and interstellar ambitions. The rank and file of the armies must be aware of what is at stake in every war and transhumanism must become the norm in everyday life."

Unlike Purists, they do not have strong feelings about genetics, since they generally consider spiritual and physical bodies separate entities. They blame rampant materialism and the rejection of faith and moral values for the Great Mistake."
 GEN_individualized_collectivism: "Individualized Collectivism"
 GEN_individualized_collectivism_desc: "There exists a social contract between the collective and the individual, that the former shall not intrude on the natural rights of the latter, but in turn is expected to receive full aid when needed. So it is true - we must not seek to overthrow our civilization in some revolutionary wave or trample on the people’s rights. Rather, our objective should be to merge collective and individual power for the betterment of humanity."
 GEN_power_of_the_will: "Power of the Will"
 GEN_power_of_the_will_desc: "A person is only as strong as their will. Our people must steel themselves against the horrors of the world, but also retain good morals and social cohesion.

 GEN_brain_studies: "Brain Studies"
 GEN_brain_studies_desc: "While the radical progressives seek to completely alter the human genome and introduce artificial modifications, we remain superior in our devotion to pure humanity. Instead of dabbling with human features, we will instead focus our efforts on unlocking the true power of the human mind."
 GEN_manual_calculations: "Manual Calculations"
 GEN_manual_calculations_desc: "A critical issue with computers is that they can be hacked. It is then ever more the pity that we must be on guard not only against our enemies, but also corrupt individuals seeking to manipulate data in their own favor to the detriment of the greater society. Instead of crippling our minds by over relying on computers, administrators and other bureaucrats will be required to manually recalculate critical data to make sure that mistakes and fraud do not slip in."
 GEN_monumentalism: "Monumentalism"
 GEN_monumentalism_desc: "We must dedicate our best builders towards the establishment of great monuments. The ancient architectural style that emphasized large and inspiring structures. Although these may not be fully practical in respect to their actual services, the buildings must instill a sense of awe in those who gaze upon them. This way we can better shape our cultural identity and bring out the inner artist."
 GEN_superior_work_ethic: "Superior Work Ethic"

 GEN_dogmatic_morals: "Dogmatic Morals"
 GEN_dogmatic_morals_desc: "Although Divinity does not necessarily claim to be a religious ideology, our constituents include many traditionalist groups. By confirming our alliance with them, we can instill in society the doctrine of dogmatism, or the belief in following righteous principles in the face of greater opposition. A society without strong morals is doomed to crumble anyway."
 GEN_euthenics: "Euthenics"
 GEN_euthenics_desc: "In our ceaseless pursuit of space colonization, we must not neglect the common folk. Our nation is built on the backs of workers, soldiers, scientists, everybody. We should reinvest our current surpluses into the betterment of living conditions for everyone."
 GEN_mind_over_matter: "Mind Over Matter"
 GEN_mind_over_matter_desc: "The triumph of the human spirit is only possible through an increased focus on thinking capacities. In an age of automation, the physical strength of a person holds but a fraction of importance relative to their ability to reason and think autonomously. Our society can only benefit by coming to terms with this obvious fact."

 GEN_divinist_governance_desc: "‘Go as I direct.\nDo as I bid.\nWhy should my hand not control you?\nI see horizons you do not see.\nI make plans you cannot fathom.’\n-Bhagavad 4\n\nDivinity is a spiritualist ideology, believing in the divinity of the human mind. Unlike Purists, they do not have strong feelings about genetics, since they generally consider spiritual and physical bodies separate entities. They blame rampant materialism and the rejection of faith and moral values for the Great Mistake."

They seek to make nature itself more resilient to make their way of life sustainable. They blame the fragility of the environment and humanity’s failure to adapt it to their will for the Great Mistake."
 GEN_adaptive_designs: "Adaptive Designs"
 GEN_adaptive_designs_desc: "It is an unfortunate fact that most of the Earth is devastated with pollution and debris. This reality has prevented expansion into certain regions due to poor supply, but worse is that, as global conditions continue to deteriorate, an automated lifestyle becomes less and less feasible. Machine designs should be remade from the ground up to allow for auxiliaries to pass through difficult terrain and bad weather."
 GEN_eminent_domain: "Eminent Domain"
 GEN_eminent_domain_desc: "Current settlement layouts are impractical and had been created during the hectic Dark Ages. To maximize efficiency, certain cities and townships will need to be replanned and buildings reconstructed elsewhere. A law allowing our government to reorganize and demolish buildings as needed should be forced through immediately."
 GEN_fortress_doctrine: "Fortress Doctrine"
 GEN_fortress_doctrine_desc: "Our country may soon be assailed by our foes. We must prepare for all future wars by embracing the ‘Fortress Doctrine’, which dictates that local safety is to be ensured before any foreign campaigns are to begin."
 GEN_terraforming: "Terraforming"
 GEN_terraforming_desc: "The environment is declining all around us, but we have the means to save parts of it. Radical scientist groups have proposed plans for the terraforming of certain areas to better facilitate human survival. We should redirect our efforts towards subsidizing efforts to recreate pre-Mistake lands."
 GEN_automated_labor: "Automated Labor"
 GEN_automated_labor_desc: "The machine is strong. It does not break easily. It does not sleep. It is precise. While some have foolishly questioned the ethicality of using a ‘machine slave pool’ to forward human goals, we know better than to let modern advances in automation go to waste."
 GEN_industrial_automation: "Industrial Automation"
 GEN_industrial_automation_desc: "Among the many respects in which machines outclass humans is the area of construction. Humans are limited by fatigue, the need to rest, and can only carry so many materials. On the other hand, automatons can be used in factories to ferry large quantities of heavy goods, engineer entire projects with great precision, and don’t require benefits pay."
 GEN_drone_hives: "Drone Hives"
 GEN_drone_hives_desc: "Drone Hives are the bots of the future. Large buildings housing thousands upon thousands of drones are to be erected. These flying craft are specially designed for certain niche purposes, such as battlefield medicine or targeting assistance. Sufficient quantities of drones can free up a lot of assets from the front lines."
 GEN_auxiliary_combat_ais: "Auxiliary Combat AIs"
 GEN_auxiliary_combat_ais_desc: "Though machines have not yet reached the point of replacing humans from the field of battle entirely, they can still serve some auxiliary combat functions such as tactical and strategic controls, logistic planners, and scouts."
 GEN_mastery_of_nature: "Mastery of Nature"
 GEN_mastery_of_nature_desc: "Our great nation has achieved that which superpowers of centuries long gone have struggled to do: master nature. The Earth is still crumbling, of that there is no doubt, but at least we now have the theoretical base for mass terraforming which will be put to use immediately by replacing forests and wastelands with more traversable terrain."

 GEN_social_cohesion: "Social Cohesion"
 GEN_social_cohesion_desc: "We must strive to better our culture through inclusiveness and equality. All members of all beliefs and values must be respected and given some degree of power. It is only through temperance, democracy, and equality that we shall achieve our future."
 GEN_global_neutrality: "Global Neutrality"
 GEN_global_neutrality_desc: "While some form of great war in the future is inevitable, and despite our localized conflicts with other nations, we must try to improve our international relations. After the Great Mistake, many countries adopted xenophobic policies, but by abstaining from international wars, we can focus on internal development, and only intervene once we are completely ready."
 GEN_vertical_sustenance: "Vertical Sustenance"
 GEN_vertical_sustenance_desc: "Farming is extremely difficult in the 23rd century. Horizontal agriculture is vulnerable to dust storms and fallout from distant wars, so we should refocus our efforts on vertical agriculture. By building farms in skyscrapers, we can protect them more efficiently and utilize automation and economies of scale to our advantage."
 GEN_united_front: "United Front"
 GEN_united_front_desc: "Now that our nation has secured itself against immediate concerns, we can have another look at the political sphere: it is dominated by corrupt politicians and power hungry elites. We need to reinforce our centrist stance on major issues so as to avoid future issues."
 GEN_evolved_party_system: "Evolved Party System"
 GEN_evolved_party_system_desc: "Our political system must transcend any one ideology. To encourage meritocratic and democratic representation of all candidates, we should put mass media to good use by slandering major parties and thereby encouraging the voters to view candidates on their own merit, without overemphasizing other politicians."
 GEN_ethical_calculus: "Ethical Calculus"
 GEN_ethical_calculus_desc: "Our people must understand the importance of war. Even if we try our best to avoid open conflict, inevitably somebody is bound to come knocking on the door with a sword. The common folk should have a grasp of basic geopolitics so that we do not have to experience crippling protests when push comes to shove."
 GEN_divergent_evolution: "Divergent Evolution"
 GEN_divergent_evolution_desc: "Not all people are equal in thought, and some are more radical than others. As long as we can suppress the latter, the common folk should have free reign over their bodies and how they wish to augment them. Though some paths may diverge, our people must remain united, because only then can they persevere."
 GEN_radical_suppression: "Radical Suppression"
 GEN_radical_suppression_desc: "The world is full of radicals waiting in the shadows, eager to pounce on weak and unstable countries to enact their bloodthirsty rule. We must be a vanguard against all forms of political extremism. Through temperance we stand tall, nevermind our own methods."
 GEN_utiliarianism: "Utilitarianism"
 GEN_utiliarianism_desc: "Our government must work towards the betterment of all people, regardless of extremist fringe groups or dying schools of philosophical thought. We must shed all attachments to other nations in the name of pragmatism, as today’s friend may become tomorrow’s enemy. Our nation exists to service itself only."

They blame the failing of long-held cultural values for the Great Mistake."
 GEN_social_mores: "Social Mores"
 GEN_social_mores_desc: "There is a uniquely human way of living life. It emphasizes the enshrinement of all that is sacred to the species: our morals, our ethics, and our devotion to those who came before - and who sacrificed so much that we could remain here."
 GEN_conservative_humanism: "Conservative Humanism"
 GEN_conservative_humanism_desc: "Over the course of the 22nd century, the term ‘Humanism’ has gradually come to be nearly synonymous to a cult of progress. Supremacist and Synergist groups view this ideology as espousing ultimate progress, but we know better. We will need to redefine what progress entails and adopt a conservative outlook upon unabashed, even shameless progress."
 GEN_limited_augmentation: "Limited Augmentation"
 GEN_limited_augmentation_desc: "Despite our strict adherence to the original human body and mind, we must concede that some augmentations are necessary, if not ultimately good. Minor changes such as backup heart growths, mind enhancements, mechanical limbs, wartime augmentations, and brain chips will be allowed when the person in question is reliant on them for survival."
 GEN_united_struggle: "United Struggle"
 GEN_united_struggle_desc: "We need to work with our allies to form a united front against the enemies of original humanity. We can draft economic blocs and military alliances to secure each other's territories and promote conservative humanist policies."
 GEN_recolonization_corps: "Recolonization Corps"
 GEN_recolonization_corps_desc: "It should be our great goal to recolonize the lands lost to natural calamities over the centuries. A committee on organizing repopulation and migration efforts should be formed, completely subservient to government control, or maybe we can introduce corporate interests into the affair. We should also focus on limited terraforming, so as to make those places viable for long-term human habitation again."
 GEN_reassimilation: "Reassimilation"
 GEN_reassimilation_desc: "The technological barbarism committed by the Supremacists and Harmonists is an affront to nature itself! Whenever we capture a formerly augmentalist settlement, the top priority should be to de-augment those who can survive the procedure and close down all augmentation stores and surgeries."
 GEN_channeled_wrath: "Channeled Wrath"
 GEN_channeled_wrath_desc: "Our soldiers must know that they are risking their lives for a goal far greater than any of us - the survival of the human race, in its original and natural form. The army must learn this through new training courses that emphasize maintaining order in occupied areas and offensive in-depth operations on the field of battle."
 GEN_ubuntu: "Ubuntu"
 GEN_ubuntu_desc: "All humans are, by nature, kind and compassionate beings. Our nation must tap into this internal strength by forging a tighter community, which will in turn produce a more responsible and productive society. State and nationcraft will be merged with social engineering to create a whole new school of thought concerned with the retention of humanity on Earth."
 GEN_historic_doctrine: "Historic Doctrine"
 GEN_historic_doctrine_desc: "The most important aspect of modern schooling is history. The hard sciences are but tools to maintain the fabric of society - but what is the point in living if one has forgotten those who came before? Our nation is built on a sky-high mound of corpses of those who came before. We must ensure that the sacrifices of our ancestors were not in vain."

 GEN_monorail_initiative: "Monorail Initiative"
 GEN_monorail_initiative_desc: "By adhering to the doctrine of mechanical modification, we should pursue greater studies in the fields of communication and physical development. The monorails will help connect our country like never before, allowing us to spread the wise words of progress to all corners of the world."
 GEN_synthetic_thought: "Synthetic Thought"
 GEN_synthetic_thought_desc: "Current advances in AI have been lagging behind prior expectations, largely due to a lack of proper funding. We need to remedy this situation by establishing isolated facilities for the research of singularity. Sufficient monetary input should be able to fund the creation of more complex AIs that will repay their investment many times."
 GEN_energy_maximization: "Energy Maximization"

 GEN_combat_pragmatism: "Combat Pragmatism"
 GEN_combat_pragmatism_desc: "We do not fight war for the sake of glory - it is a bloody and costly affair, and one that is best finished as soon as started. Our military should reflect this philosophy by focusing on raw pragmatism. Operations should focus on maximizing strategic achievements and tactical battles should be fought only when absolutely necessary."
 GEN_memeweb: "Memeweb"
 GEN_memeweb_desc: "In an increasingly re-connected world, communication allows for the rapid spread of great ideas. Instead of relying on generic propaganda vehicles, we can instead focus on popular culture to insert subliminal messaging into the media. This should help us maintain societal cohesion on a social level."
 GEN_datalink_consolidation: "Datalink Consolidation"
 GEN_datalink_consolidation_desc: "Following the Great Mistake, the ancient ‘Internet’ was ruined by the Kessler Syndrome and a general lack of accessibility. In the following decades, it has been supplanted by the localized Network Nodes. We should connect these individual nodes into a more concrete, but still well-protected web, so as to allow for a freer flow of digital activities in the state."
 GEN_monomyth: "Monomyth"
 GEN_monomyth_desc: "Our nation is, in fact, on the path to a great future. In days long past, this journey was visible through folklore and historical epics. Today, many people see the Supremacist movement as inherently anti-human. To counteract this blasphemous notion, we should encourage a new form of cultural expression by subsidizing the arts and cultural AI matrixes."
 GEN_orbital_interoperability: "Orbital Interoperability"
 GEN_orbital_interoperability_desc: "We can greatly cut down on satellite costs by phasing out Kessler Syndrome protection components. In their stead we will use AI-matrixes guided protocols that will help satellites maneuver around each other in case of orbital storms. This system can be further developed by allowing satellites to repair each other through specialized orbital drone hives."
 GEN_perfectionism: "Perfectionism"
 GEN_perfectionism_desc: "The perfect Supremacist is a polymath, skilled in the sciences, but also well-versed in the human side of life.

 GEN_frugality: "Frugality"

 GEN_natural_preserves: "Natural Preserves"
 GEN_natural_preserves_desc: "The natural world must be maintained, or our ideology will lose its grand roots. We should draft a governmental state board for the establishment of natural parks and preserves, free from government and market interference, where the people can come to enjoy nature and marvel at the surviving species of the green world."
 GEN_ecoscaping: "Ecoscaping"
 GEN_ecoscaping_desc: "As much as we may want to preserve all natural habitats, the world demands that we be prepared for any conflict. As such, some sacrifices have to be made, and certain areas must be uprooted and converted into sprawling factory complexes. To compromise, we should relocate natural assets to specialized facilities and habitats."
 GEN_genetic_modifications: "Genetic Modifications"
 GEN_genetic_modifications_desc: "As part of our just movement, we have accepted the augmentalists into our ranks. These differ from their mechanics-oriented counterparts by focusing on genetic and biological augmentation, such as back-up hearts or extra fingers, rather than raw implants. We can further foster this level of modification by funding scientists and university projects focusing on rapid human evolution experiments."
 GEN_tissue_growing: "Tissue Growing"
 GEN_tissue_growing_desc: "It has become possible to regrow major tissue in the human body, albeit it is an expensive and very slow process. However, by additional funding into genetic research, we can accelerate this process to greatly extend the human lifespan and make deep wounds healable."
