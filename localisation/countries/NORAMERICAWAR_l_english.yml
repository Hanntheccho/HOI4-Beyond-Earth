 noramericawar_decisions_desc: "§LNorth America is a land of desperation, turmoil and tired eyes eternally searching the horizon for any symbol of hope. Be it the reigning authority, the vocal opposition, or one of many fringe alternatives brewing under the surface, the people of a ravaged continent are more than willing to fight for what they are convinced is their shriveled embodiment of a potential future. An ideological conflict is inevitable, and it will no doubt ravage the lands of Old America in an all-consuming hellfire. Already, an unspoken is being fought in the minds of the people, and this victory may be more important than the one won with steel and blood.\n\nSeveral factions vie for authority across the districts of the North American Union and their competing legitimacy in the minds of its people will be the greatest deciding factor in the conflict to come, whether it be the rising giants of Central and the ARC, or a new rising power come to usurp the old order.§!\n\n§O4th American Civil War Progress§! - §R[?global.noramericawarprogress_var|2]%§!\n§O4th American Civil War Progress§! rises by [?global.napgain_var|Y2]§Y%§! every week.\n\n§GYou can check the status of both sides by opening the NAU Legitimacy mapmode.
