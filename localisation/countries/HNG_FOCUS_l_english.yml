 HNG_Until_It_Is_Faced_desc: "If we fail to win against our foes, England will die. The English people will die. We will die, all of us, our mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, brothers, sisters, friends, lovers. All of them will fall beneath the waves. We’re dead either way, best to fight for what’s right."

 HNG_Source_German_Aid_desc: "The Germans have always been funding us since the Treaty of Bern. While never said in the open, everyone knows where we source our weapons and political funding from. It seems like the perfect time to draw on our contacts."

But the technicalities will come when we have the reins of power, for now we can just give our word that we will instate these jobs for our followers."

 HNG_Our_Last_Chance_desc: "This is it, we’ve tried everything we can, all we can do now is attempt one last push into enemy territory. Our commitment to our cause shall lead us through the battlefield. If we are to die, at least we die trying to prevent others from befalling the same fate."
