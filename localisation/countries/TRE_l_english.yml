 TRE_absence_of_civilization: "Absence of Civilization"
 TRE_absence_of_civilization_desc: "The land once known as the East Coast is dead and buried under the sea. Following the Great Mistake, the entire populations of New York, Boston, and other ancient metropoli fled for the Midwest. As expected, the unstable Federal government was unable to deal with mass migration and buckled in the 2nd American Civil War. Famine set in. Families turned into gangs and friends killed friends just for a slice of meat. So it continues to this day. The East Coast is in complete anarchy. The only authority comes from ARC's enforcers, who have fortified checkpoints and refugee camps, bringing some semblance of order to the wastes."
 TRE_the_last_earthlings: "The Last Earthlings"
 TRE_the_last_earthlings_desc: "Were a person to travel back to the 21st century and question its inhabitants as to the projected situation of the United Nations two hundred years forward, few would have guessed that the once global organization would be hanging on to dear life in some backwater. But this is indeed the case, and Earth's finest (as they like to call themselves) have been stranded in New England for centuries. Children have heard stories of wars and the apocalypse from their soldier-parents, grown into adults and died while still wearing the UN insignia.\n\nThe dream of a united Earth lives on, fueled by loss and regret. Perhaps the Coasts have nothing left to lose, or perhaps, in some rusted half-sunk home is a new generation, born into poverty but kept alive by stories of a wonderful world that awaits just beyond the horizon..."

 TRE_arc_oversight_board: "Oversight Board" #ARC Oversight
 TRE_arc_oversight_board_desc: "The ARC Oversight Board is a ruling council composed of 20 members, 18 of whom are direct corporate representatives from ARC itself. Assigned to the District with the stated goal of maintaining order and reviving civilization, the Board's members have elected to build up their strength by going on vacations and purchasing the newest augmentations. ARC would do something about this insubordination, but is too preoccupied with global concerns. The Board controls the only organized military force in the District, the 68th and 45th ARC Peacekeeping Divisions.\n\nWhile opposed at nearly every opportunity by local interest groups and the United Nations), the Oversight Board's power is near total. The Board commands full respect in the cities by controlling their water flow and ration intakes. While dissent is theoretically meant to be dealt with swiftly, the Board has been accused of neglecting its duties and allowing the raiders to grow out of control."

############ EVENTS ###########

 tre_event.1.t: "Dragons"
 tre_event.1.d: "Winter was difficult in old Pennsylvania. Apart from the ever-present threat of bandit attacks, villages had to make do with limited harvests. The lack of modern harvesters, combined with gang warfare and regular livestock raids, meant that no agriculture was possible beyond the sustenance level. As villagers were forced to spend most of the year farming, superstitions and legends returned to the popular imagination. Common practices included the planting of seeds under specific stars, the making of totems to ward off raiders and evil spirits, and preset seating arrangements.\n\nDifferent villages had different beliefs, but a common trait found in all was an intense fear of the unknown. Villagers often avoided untrodden trails, lest they lead to a faceless monster in the woods, or a mind horror along the abandoned shores.\n\nIn one village (which happened to be situated near a small mountain), the inhabitants were convinced that a dragon lived in the nearby cave. When ARC engineers arrived to repair a barn, they were told tales of a fire-breathing monster stealing cattle and young women during the dead of night. The local militia, armed with pitchforks and pre-war hunting rifles, once organized a hunt to find and slay the beast. Few returned, but those who did retold a haunting scene: the dragon had scales made of steel, it incinerated people with its breath, and had giant red eyes. Since the incident, the locals have voted to abandon their settlement and move in with their neighbors a few miles over."
 tre_event_option.1.a: "It's just urban legends"
 tre_event.2.t: "Learning So Painfully"
 tre_event.2.d: "UN Headquarters was one of the most populous settlements in District 3, which said more about the sorry state of District 3 than it did about UN Headquarters. \n\nThe founding of the community had breathed new life into a half-ruined Pre-Mistake town, which had served as a command post for UN peacekeepers and aid workers deployed to the stricken East Coast. Even back then, people had flocked there out of desperation or a desire to help how they could. The UN’s ignoble death at the hands of panicked isolationism hadn’t been enough to change what had blossomed from those small seeds. Everything that had come after – from the refurbished pre-Mistake tenements to the modern prefab buildings – had grown from the selflessness and compassion of those who had chosen to continue their mission when the blue flag had seemingly lowered for the last time. UN Headquarters was not a wealthy or advanced settlement, but everyone had a place there. \n\nPravin Lal enjoyed his walks through the place. It was a much-needed reminder that there was hope for the world. There was the clinic, where those turned away from underfunded NAU hospitals or extortive ARC clinics could receive treatment. There was the school, easily the largest centre of learning left on the East Coast. There were community vegetable gardens in the parks and on the rooftops, ensuring few went hungry. It was still little more than a shantytown by pre-Mistake standards, which many locals mourned to no end. But the fact that they had enough of an education about the old world to make that comparison left them far ahead of so many others in the so-called North American Union. Focusing on day-to-day survival made it hard to remember the past. For Lal, it was impossible for forget. \n\nThe memorial wall was an early addition to the settlement, erected outside the town hall that had ultimately grown into the new General Assembly Building. Photographs, dogtags and even a few blue helmets adorned the wall, lit by candles flickering in the breeze. The memorial was under constant vigil from junior bluehelmets, who accepted the duty of protecting and maintaining it with immense respect. They were there that day as always, distinct in their uniforms among the usual throngs of mourners. It was at the wall that they and everyone else at UN Headquarters paid their respects. Peacekeepers honored siblings-in-arms who had fallen in the line of duty. Families grieved loved ones lost to the tragedies that played out across the District each day."
 tre_event_option.2.a: "And every week, Lal went there to leave a flower for Pria."
 tre_event.3.t: "The Day When She Left Me"
 tre_event.3.d: "Pria. She was smiling in her photograph, eyes full of life as she and a younger Pravin stood together at the opening of the new clinic building. They’d met at the old one during a difficult operation made nearly impossible by the ramshackle facilities. But somehow, between his Arcopolis education on cutting-edge medicine and her experience as a backwater medic, they’d saved a life that most had given up on. It was when Pravin declared the operation a success – and their eyes met from opposite sides of the patient – that he realized he had fallen in love with her. \n\nFor so many joyous years, it had felt like the despair that always clouded his horizon had cleared. They got married in a public ceremony at the new clinic’s chapel. They supported each other as he rose through the ranks and she dedicated herself to her patients. They had a son, and watched him grow into respectable young man. So much loss and viciousness had still filled the world, with even District 3 feeling like a lost cause at times. But on the nights they sat on their tenement’s roof watching the stars, it had still felt like there was a future.\n\nAnd it all ended in a senseless bandit raid on a struggling town where she’d gone to offer aid. \n\nThere’d been a time Lal had been filled with sheer, loathing anger: at the bandits for Pria’s death, at the NAU for District 3’s anarchy, at humanity as a whole for the Great Mistake. That flame had burnt itself out inside him, leaving an emptiness that had somehow hurt even more. But those days, something was starting to flicker. It had started the day he learned of another bandit raid – one utterly similar to the one that had claimed Pria’s life, and utterly similar to the dozens reported in a given month. The realization of which being precisely what had been what set him off. Now, that flicker was coalescing into a grim, bitter resolve that Pria’s death would not be in vain, and that he could prevent the tragedy of her death from being repeated onto others."
 tre_event_option.3.a: "He placed his flower beside Pria’s photograph, before walking away to make room for the other mourners to have their grief."
