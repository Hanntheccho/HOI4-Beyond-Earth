 JNG_Dispose_Of_The_Old_desc: "The root of an ideology is its leaders.

 JNG_Dispose_Of_The_Democrats_desc: "Our inevitable march to victory has been halted by a slight roadblock.

 JNG_Fell_The_Trees_desc: "Even in the vile NLP Government, there were always a few valiant reactionaries attempting to fight NSA influence from within the party. Most of them have flocked to our cause now, but the same cannot be said for the disgusting mongrels in the Spring Party. They have prostrated themselves before INTEGR and the Germans all for a shred of legitimacy, whereas we have found genuine, erstwhile allies. Should Kenney and her band of deceived fools come to power, it would mean nothing more than German puppetry of our nation."
