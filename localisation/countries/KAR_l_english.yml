 KAR_parliament: "Karjala Parliament"
 KAR_parliament_desc: "The Parliament of Karjala, founded in the wake of the Spring Coup, is composed of Finnish and Russian representatives, led by a Speaker from each side. Although many political and ideological lines exist, the government (and the nation as a whole) is divided by nationality. Finnish migrants have already outpaced the native Slavs in population, but the latter maintains control over many businesses and the army.\n\nThe Karjala Parliament is at a crossroads. On the one hand, it has many internal issues, such as agricultural insecurity, poverty, migration and a high crime rate. On the other, by abandoning its sovereignty to another power, such as Eurasia or Finland itself, Karjala may be able to achieve some degree of prosperity."

 KAR_duma: "Karelian Duma"
 KAR_duma_desc: "To another hundred years!\n\nThe Karelian Duma, a self-proclaimed successor assembly to that of the Russian Federation, resides in the desolate reaches of the far North. Isolated from the bulk of former revolutionary forces in Siberia, the situation in Karelia worsens by the day. Constant equipment shortages, corruption, ethnic tensions between Slavs and migrating Finnish tribes have taken their toll on the rump state.\n\nDue to the Byzantine politics of the Republic, the Duma has no president or acting representative - instead, every member is entitled to a vote and theoretically represents a region of old Russia - even if they had never been there. Decision-making is only possible due to the shared hatred of Eurasia, which sits over the lake, bidding its time until Karelia is starved out. The Duma has other plans."

 KAR_keepers_of_revolution: "Keepers Of The Revolutionary Flame"
 KAR_keepers_of_revolution_desc: "The Russian Republic, currently based in Karelia, is the descendant of the failed Republican Revolution of 2156. Once encompassing much of Siberia and old Russia, the Revolution has fortified its peninsula in hopes of waiting out the Moscow Regime. But as Eurasia grows stronger by the day, the Russian Republic must strike soon or die."
 KAR_finno_slavic_tension: "Finno-Slavic Tensions"
 KAR_finno_slavic_tension_desc: "The Karelian lands have long been emptied of their namesake population - what is left are squabbling tribes of Slavs and Finnish refugees fleeing from the West. National divisions are high, and although the Republic preaches peace between the two groups, daily brawls and shootouts are not an uncommon sight."

############ EVENTS ###########
###############################

 karelia_event.1.t: "From Federation To Union"
 karelia_event.1.d: "The Russian Republican Revolution gambled and lost. The Eurasian Union State, founded shortly after the Great Mistake, made great strides in reasserting control over Eastern Europe. The states of Ukraine and Belarus, crippled by the collapse of European economies, folded quickly.\n\nBut Russian supremacy was not established. In a move of supreme stupidity, the old Federation rebranded into Eurasia, encouraging non-Russian politicians and granting autonomy rights to minorities. While a commendable act in theory, Eurasia betrayed its roots and decentralized the country to a crippling level. All of its disasters, from the Central Asian Campaign to anarchy, are surely the product of a lack of central authority."
 karelia_event_option.1.a: "Grave mistakes"
 karelia_event.2.t: "The State of Karelia"
 karelia_event.2.d: "The Kazakhs kicked in the door back in 2156, albeit without fully realizing it. In 2154, the Eurasian Union State, suffering from famines and stagnation, invaded Central Asia to dominate its resource centers and gain control over Aral Sea irrigation. The war was meant to be a quick march from Outer Orenburg to Tashkent, but logistical issues and low morale dragged the war across two years. Worse yet, the Central Asian states united to survive, eventually driving back Eurasian armies and leading to the Great Rout of Army Group South into the Urals.\n\nIt was in 2156 that the Republican Revolution exploded. Our predecessors marched on the Core, rallying across many cities. Alas, Eurasia withstood the Revolution and we were scattered by shock troops retreating from the front. By the end of the decade, cities like Omsk were lost to the Asians and the Urals fell into anarchy."
 karelia_event_option.2.a: "The future of Russia rests on us"
 karelia_event.3.t: "Throwing A Light"
 karelia_event.3.d: "Revolutionary remnants were split: the vast majority of our supporters, including soldiers and protestors, chose to flee to Siberia rather than face Moscow's wrath. There they remain today, isolated and assaulted by hordes of Chinese immigrants fleeing the floods. Meanwhile, Eurasia licks its wounds. The countryside of old Russia is destroyed, commanded by bandit kings and still stuck in the 21st century.\n\nBut in Karelia, the leadership of the Revolution has made its stand. Our situation is perilous, but we will prevail. Millions of Finns have fled East following Helsinki's demise, leading to rising ethnic tension. Due to this, we have been forced to cede much political power to these immigrants, and if we fail to enter Moscow, they may attempt an overthrow of the government. We lack time, industry, manpower, everything. Eurasia, while weak, grows stronger by the day. We must fight or die."
 karelia_event_option.3.a: "Into the Future"
 karelia_event.4.t: "Finnish Coup!"
 karelia_event.4.d: "Revolutionary remnants were split: the vast majority of our supporters, including soldiers and protestors, chose to flee to Siberia rather than face Moscow's wrath.

 karelia_event_option.4.a: "The Revolution dies."
 karelia_event.5.t: "Russia is Ours!"
 karelia_event.5.d: "The Russian Republican Revolution is finally successful. After years of devastating war, deaths of our people, destruction of our cities, it is finally over. Russian heartland has been reclaimed, and the government will move from Karelia back to Moscow in a moment's notice. There is still much to be done - rebuilding Russia from the horrible state it is now, ending anarchy in the Urals, and uniting with our Siberian brothers - and that's before we can look outwards, to a rapidly changing world. But, today is the day for celebration. We have taken the first step in a long path of Russian rebirth. It is a great day that will change the history of our fatherland forever."
 karelia_event_option.5.a: "Slavsya, Rossiya!"
 karelia_event.6.t: "Our Ambitions"
 karelia_event.6.d: "Before the Great Mistake, Russia was a superpower. The biggest country on Earth, with the biggest military, stretching from Poland to Manchuria. We were the bastion of science, the first country to go into space, leading dozens of younger nations to a brighter future. At least, it's one way to look at our history - some refer to it as a decadent, oppressive empire, that collapsed into itself time after time because of its own destructive nature. Currently, the government is disunited on this issue. If we consider our past glorious, we'll try to bring it back - creating a strong, centralized state that will retake both core Russian land, and bring our former subjects back into the fold. To wage war in the 23rd century is hard, and we had problems controlling even a third of Russia! Evaluation of this plan ranges from wishful thinking and idealism to downright insanity, from the second wing of our Duma. They claim that the only part forward for Russia is focusing on our own country, and cooperating with the West to do so, perhaps even joining a major European alliance, holding a free election, and establishing a genuine, pluralist democracy first and foremost. After rounds of heated debate, our conclusion is…"
 karelia_event_option.6.a: "Fight for a Great Russia! Embrace our ambitions!"
 karelia_event_option.6.b: "Fight for a Better Russia! Reject our greed!"
 karelia_event.7.t: "Our European Friends"
 karelia_event.7.d: "With our course finally decided, Russia is at crossroads once again. It is obvious that we must pick one of the European forces to align ourselves with, and after some evaluation, we found two fitting candidates. First, Germany and its INTEGR. Focused on ecology and diplomacy, they will be of a great help reconstructing Russia, and are perhaps the most progressive political block at this moment. And second, the North Sea Alliance. Led by Scotland, their main objective is reclaiming land lost to Great Mistake, and creating cities floating on water - ARKs. Both of those options will be essential in our rebirth, and change our politics greatly."
 karelia_event_option.7.a: "INTEGR is a better option"
 karelia_event_option.7.b: "We should petition to enter The North Sea Alliance"

 heirs_of_russia: "Heirs of Russia"
 heirs_of_russia_desc: "Karelia finds itself in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the Finnish population is growing and immigrant communities are becoming restless. Already, minor terrorist attacks have taken place on government offices. Brawls between Russians and Finns are a common sight. The immigrants are demanding more representation in government, which may be the death of the Russian Republican Revolution.\n\nTo counteract popular discontent, Karelia prepares for war against Eurasia. Indeed, the Karelian peninsula was always meant to be a springboard for a full reclamation of old Russia. But the Republic will have to strike soon and strike fast for the Union State is growing exponentially stronger by the day."

 KAR_SIB_alliance: "The Republican Coalition"
 KAZ_KAZ_alliance: "The Enemy of My Enemy..."

 #

 #KAR_forlorn_hope: "Forlorn Hope"
 #KAR_forlorn_hope_desc: "The Republic of Russia lives! Denied our Revolution by the vile government in Moscow, self-exiled to frozen Karelia, destined to waste away… nay we say! With each passing day, Eurasia grows stronger, outpacing our already outdated military. But there is an opportunity…"

 #KAR_fortress_karelia: "Fortress Karelia"
 #KAR_fortress_karelia_desc: "While our inevitable war against Eurasia relies on offensive tactics, the lack of soldiers will make it difficult to push on multiple fronts. We must select one area to fortify and hold against the tide, and another to push through."

 #KAR_refocus_the_market: "Refocus The Market"
 #KAR_refocus_the_market_desc: "It is no secret that the Karelian peninsula lacks any sort of advanced economy. Our main exports are seafood to Scandenavian countries, and metals from the South. We will need to focus our economy on wartime production if we want to have any chance of beating Eurasia."

 #KAR_magnetic_cranes: "Magnetic Cranes"
 #KAR_magnetic_cranes_desc: "Construction is difficult on the peninsula. The cold temperatures greatly limit work hours, and clashes between Slavs and Finns often result in collateral damage. We should import some magnetic construction cranes from Europe to assist in reconstruction efforts. "

 #KAR_gun_running: "Gun Running"
 #KAR_gun_running_desc: "Some of our traders have contacted pirates and smugglers in the North Atlantic. We can capitalize on this opportunity to import stolen infantry equipment and weapons from Western Europe and North America."

 #KAR_our_siberian_brothers: "Our Siberian Brothers"
 #KAR_our_siberian_brothers_desc: "The bravest of our traders have found a safe route through the North, into Siberia, where the rest of the Revolutionaries are. Although this safe route is quite long and difficult to navigate, we can still rely on this connection to import old rifles and equipment."

 #KAR_local_gun_smiths: "Local Gun Smiths"
 #KAR_local_gun_smiths_desc: "We are suffering from a lack of ammunition and working firearms. We must focus our limited worker pool on producing equipment for our soldiers."

 #KAR_murmansk_autoplant: "Murmansk AutoPlant"
 #KAR_murmansk_autoplant_desc: "Wars today are won by superior maneuvering. However, we lack the means by which to create a mobile strike force. Some wealthy defectors from Eurasia are pooling their funds to open a tractor factory in Murmansk. We should send them subsidies and cut taxes on military-related operations to boost equipment production."

 #KAR_accelerated_walker_production: "Accelerated Walker Production"
 #KAR_accelerated_walker_production_desc: "The elite of our armies consist of Walker divisions. Originally defectors from the Central Asian Campaign, these armored units are not quite as powerful as main battle tanks in the Eurasian plains, but they will have to do. All of our efforts should be invested into the Walkers, to lead the charge to Moscow."

 #KAR_invite_resource_prospectors: "Invite Resource Prospectors"
 #KAR_invite_resource_prospectors_desc: "Karelia is wealthy in natural resources, but most of them are hidden deep within the Earth. We can rely on foreign experts to construct boreholes and open new mines to boost our resource production."

 #KAR_centralized_ammo_production: "Centralized Ammo Production"
 #KAR_centralized_ammo_production_desc: "Currently, gunsmiths operate independently and without cohesion. We should draft an oversight board and help foster a community between gun makers to smoothen production."

 #KAR_rally_the_russians: "Rally The Russians"
 #KAR_rally_the_russians_desc: "Propaganda is a powerful tool. Some of our people are demoralized, still living in the fading past. We should use media channels to spread word of the upcoming Revolution!"

 #KAR_tier_iv_service_training_sequence: "Tier IV Service Training Sequence"
 #KAR_tier_iv_service_training_sequence_desc: "Due to our small numbers, we must rely on quality rather than quantity. The Europeans have come up with a set of Training Sequences, organized by tiers ranging from I to X, conscripts to elite agents respectfully. We should train foot troops with the Tier IV sequence, which includes harsh weather training, urban combat, rapid engagement and crowd control."

 #KAR_tier_v_service_training_sequence: "Tier V Service Training Sequence"
 #KAR_tier_v_service_training_sequence_desc: "Now that the Tier IV sequence is engrained in the soldiers" mindset, we can promote high-achieving officers to the Tier V training sequence. This includes woodland and mountain training, naval duties, aircraft piloting and long-distance combat."

 #KAR_rally_the_finns: "Rally The Finns"
 #KAR_rally_the_finns_desc: "Some say that it is not their fight. The Finnish immigrants are just observers in the conflict between Russia and Eurasia. This is false. By living within the borders of the rightful Russia, the Finnish immigrants should be required to serve in the military. These conscripts are too unreliable to fight on the frontlines, but can fill auxiliary roles."

 #KAR_make_promises: "Make Promises"
 #KAR_make_promises_desc: "Our Revolution is built on the will of the people. If they forsake Republican leadership, our powerbase will crumble. To avoid this fate, we can make wild promises to raise spirits and encourage further military enlistment."

 #KAR_memories_of_home: "Memories Of Home"
 #KAR_memories_of_home_desc: "This is a great struggle! We must return to our homeland, slay this Eurasian abomination, and restore the proper Russian Republic. Although many of our people have been denied access to the homeland of their ancestors, they are nonetheless eager to take it back."
