 PER_farhad_hushang: "Farhad Hushang"
 PER_farhad_hushang_desc: "Iran is a nation of nations, ethnicities of little relation rallied under the banner of whichever strongman happens to be in charge this week.\n\nThis week's strongman is Dr. Farhad Hushang, former professor of engineering at the University of Tehran. After the collapse of the Dana Regime, Iran was left in a sorry state, without much to propel itself forward now that the oil had dried up. The universities and colleges of Tehran and Isfahan took over in a lot of respects, being the most trusted institutions in their cities. After coalescing influence over the better part of a century, a clique of generals aligned with technocratic factions within the University of Tehran took power in the 2190 Revolution. Farhad Hushang was the most competent, organised and shrewd member of the technocratic faction in the UoT. He was able to use the esteem, prestige and respect that most Iranians felt for the returning generals to land himself the position of President of Iran. Ever since, he has built a large cult of personality in most Iranian cities, repackaging the intellectual babble of the Tehrani professors into soundbites for the working and middle classes to absorb through the datalinks. Iran was on a dangerous and unstable course before Hushang came into power. If anyone can right the ship before it sinks, it will be him."

 PER_humiliation: "Humiliation"
 PER_humiliation_desc: "The Shibh Aljazira War of 2188, better known as just 'The Arabian War' was the culmination of over a century of Middle Eastern power politics. It was the ultimate showdown between the century-long rivals of Iran and Turkiye, who had fought with each other over the Arabian Peninsula since anyone could remember. However, being stuck in small-scale guerilla conflicts with each other's puppet governments had left them unprepared for the utter tenacity and unfettered human wave tactics that Egypt had been busy mastering in its wars with the Maghreb, Ethiopia and the EAF. But of course, neither the proud Turks and even more proud Iranians would expect the destitute, poor, hungry Egyptians to face up to their might. The humiliation of watching the previously widely mocked and pitied Egyptians swarm the once feared Iranian Armed Forces broke the Iranian people. The overwhelming anger from the populace allowed the space-obsessed and militaristic regime of Farhad Hushang to take power in the 2190 Revolution. He now must give the people what they want, revenge against Egypt, a victory against the Turks and an Iran that can truly declare itself a great power."
 PER_squeezing_blood_from_asteroids: "Squeezing Blood From Asteroids"
 PER_squeezing_blood_from_asteroids_desc: "The majority of the population of Iran just want to see their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, fathers, uncles, aunts and cousins avenged. They want a return to being respected on the world stage and a return to an Arabia that doesn't take the pilgrimage to Mecca to pray, but takes the pilgrimage to Tehran to give tribute. This is in stark contrast with the desires of the technocratic Iranian elite, the main backers of the Hushang regime. They ascribed to a strain of thought inspired by the materialism and optimism that followed the decline of Islam in Iran. They believe that any and all efforts possible should go towards cosmic efforts, sacrificing what's necessary to give Iran a future. The main intersection of these two desires has morphed into the ideology of 'Hushangism.' Iran must expand across the Middle East, Central Asia, any land it can get its hands on so that it can pool together the manpower and resources to send off the ships. There are holes in this theory that are clear to almost every foreign observer. But Hushangism is the only way of fulfilling the desires of those that keep the regime alive, as short-sighted as it may be. Failing to deliver on these promises would likely just lead to the people with the biggest guns taking power again, thrusting Iran back into the 'Years of Terror' that haunt the country to this day."
 PER_winning_minds_not_hearts: "Winning Minds Not Hearts"
 PER_winning_minds_not_hearts_desc: "The ferocity and militarism, the intellectualism and materialism. All of that ends beyond the borders of the cities. After the collapse of the Dana regime and the end of the Years of Terror in 2108, trust between the rural and urban worlds broke. The ruralites couldn't trust that the Tehranis wouldn't force everyone under such incompetence and brutality again, whereas the urbanites couldn't trust the piety and conservatism of the rural people, after seeing it contorted and abused in such horrid ways. The Tehranis and Isfahanis surrounded themselves with the material, logical and emotional, focusing on cosmic travel and militaristic nationalism. The people of the small settlements and rural areas however, aren't as willing to march westwards to a supposed victory. Some have even been said to wish to return to Islamist government although nothing like the Dana Regime, more inspired by the form of government and Islam that the Egyptians have managed to cultivate. Internal subversion of our end goal must not be allowed to succeed in any way whatsoever."
