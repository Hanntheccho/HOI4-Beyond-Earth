  RSA_resettlement_authority: "Resettlement Authority"
  RSA_resettlement_authority_desc: "The Resettlement Authority was born from the ashes of the Settlement and Survival Committee, founded by the Great Lakes Committee in 2184 to deal with refugees in the East. The Committee's members were chosen from a pool of corporate representatives and Strike Action leaders, but soon the latter displaced the former. The Committee, much to everyone's surprise, showed results by successfully resettling two million refugees in Michigan.\n\nMany owe their and their families' lives to the Committee's members, and are ready to fight for freedom. Chicago, already weary of the Resettlement Committee's growing influence, has tried to disappear and judge its members. However, the flame was already lit and now the Great Lakes are in civil war. The Committee has rebranded as the Resettlement Authority, laying claim to the entirety of the District and its oppressed inhabitants."
