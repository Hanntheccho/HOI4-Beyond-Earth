  pnm_event.87.t: "The Patriot"
  pnm_event.87.d: "Governor Luis Segerra Reyes walked alongside the soldiers, almost oblivious to the journalists and their camera drones following after him. Instead, he was focused on the sergeant giving him a tour of the new outpost - one erected specifically to deter bandit raids across Central’s border with District 1. The threat had been one that he had been particularly vocal about seeing addressed, and he leapt at the invitation for a tour. Frankly, he was proud of the men and women staffing the base, and freely offered his admiration to every serviceperson he spoke with.\n\nIt was only after the tour that Reyes turned his attention to the press in earnest. As the governor of Central and the leader of the Patriot Party, he was expected to comment on President Cygan’s recent announcement. It had ignited a firestorm of national discussion, from reflections on Cygan’s time in office to speculations on who the Central Council would ‘elect’ to replace him. Reyes had his own thoughts on both fronts.\n\n‘First of all, I would like to thank President Cygan for his contributions to this great nation,’ Reyes said to the assembled journalists. ‘He’s served diligently in his time in office, and I wish him a speedy recovery. But at the same time, I welcome his decision to step down. It’s clear that America needs change, and needs it urgently.’\n\n‘We stand on the precipice of oblivion. Despite the efforts of Cygan and his predecessors, the Union falters. We are weakened by division, and hounded by hostiles left to run amok in our borders. We need a strong, focused leader capable of bringing America together like never before, and capable of seeing it through these dark times. That is why I will be stepping forward as the candidate of the Patriot Party, and will work tirelessly to bring together all those who love this magnificent country together in a sacred endeavor to save it.’\n\n‘Believe me, I know times are hard. I was but a young farmhand in rural Mexico in my youth, only coming to the Union after its intervention south of the border in the 170’s. I’ve not just seen the challenges of this new world, I’ve lived them. And I wouldn’t wish them on anyone. For the sake of our children, and for generations yet born, we need to turn this nation around. We need to once more be the shining city on the hill, a guiding light for the world to follow! The glory of old America was built with American hands, and by American hands will it be restored!’"
  pnm_event_option.87.a: "The journalists rolled their eyes behind their sunglasses, but the troops cheered uproariously."

  pnm_event.88.t: "Son of Elysium"
  pnm_event.88.d: "It had become fashionable for the Denver elites to flaunt their wealth with greenery - practically worth its weight in lithium in parched southern NAU. But even amidst their sprawling gardens and shining greenhouses, the Forrest family estate was a veritable oasis. For within the estate’s collection of climate-controlled domes grew specimens that could simply no longer be found elsewhere on the continent. It was a sobering thought, but the fragile blooms brought Wesley Forrest a precious glimmer of hope.\n\n‘Consider the San Francisco Gumplant, the maritima variant of the Grindelia hirsutula,’ Forrest said to the assembled journalists, indicating the pale yellow flowers. ‘Native to former California, and a rarity even in its heyday. But now, its former habitat lies underwater, and any hope of it finding purchase on the new coastline is dashed by radiation, soil degradation and good old-fashioned climate change. As best we know, the Gumplant is extinct in the wild.’\n\nHe expected little interest from the lecture, and received precisely that. Even among those who actually cared for the plight of District 1, there was little concern for flowers. Not when the barely-contained anarchy sat on Central’s very doorstep. But to Forrest, the plant was symbolic. It was far from the only part of America’s heritage that was at risk of being lost forever. And it was far from the most consequential.\n\n‘In the Gumplant, I see America,’ Forrest continued. ‘A beautiful piece of old America, clinging to life by a thread. Just like the North American Union, and the American values it claims to uphold. But we all know that the Union has failed on that front. Two entire Districts remain in effective anarchy. An unprecedented refugee crisis wracks the south, and rumblings of rebellion shake the north. Everywhere we look, everyday Americans suffer under “temporary emergency powers” that have been in place for more than a century. We cannot go on like this. Something has to change, and as the candidate for the Elysium Party I am committed to bringing it about.’\n\nBold words for a Central politician, and Forrest knew it. He had no shortage of detractors in the Central Council, be they critical of his wealthy upbringing, his comparatively young age, or - most commonly - his ideals. People had been disappeared for less. But he was, perhaps, fortunate. He’d flown below the radar for much of his early career, building up popular support on the ground with the average American, many of whom would be hard-pressed to name who their supposed representatives are. By the time he had the Central Council’s attention, he was too high-profile to be readily dealt with. But as he made his move to bring the change America so desperately needed, he could only wonder what plans the Council might have for him."

  PNM_the_fourth_branch: "The Fourth Branch"
  PNM_the_fourth_branch_desc: "After the Siege of Washington in 2084, where the military forced the pre-Mistake government into exile in order to break the political deadlock that only exacerbated the chaos gripping the country from disasters and militia violence, the Central government was never truly able to fulfill their promise of "restoring the government". Even though all three of the pre-Mistake branches are present, it's only the Executive that has any practical ability to pass policy, and even they are beholden to the Joint Chiefs.  This has led to the military often being described as "The Fourth Branch" - mostly by anti-Central factions lambasting it as a glorified military dictatorship, but occasionally by members of the Central military who feel they deserve the political influence they wield for "protecting democracy"."
  PNM_rock_bottom_popularity: "Rock-Bottom Popularity"
  PNM_rock_bottom_popularity_desc: "While the many Districts disagree, often violently, they have one agreement in common; "Central is the worst". Even citizens living within the region the Central government directly controls hate them, to the point that the military police cannot contain the rising protest movements. Whoever the Central Council appoints as President, they will need to deal with the protestors... one way, or another."

  PNM_rock_bottom_popularity_tooltip: "§RWe must assert our authority over the Union before it is too late!§!"

  PNM_central_council: "Central Council"
  PNM_central_council_desc: "In the pre-Mistake era, a phrase often associated with the United States was "It can't happen here". This sentiment was for a multitude of scenarios the citizens felt would only be plausible in elaborate works of fiction; disastrous weather tearing down entire cities, American citizens killing each other in the streets, the White House and Capitol Building being stormed by soldiers to establish martial law. Then when the Great Mistake choked the skies with ash, rising tides swallowed entire states whole, militias and gangs waged violence from coast-to-coast, and the military launched the Siege of Washington in 2084, almost every concept that Americans believed couldn't happen, did happen.\n\nWhile the Central government still has vestiges of the pre-Mistake branches of government, and had theoretically shed the pre-Mistake jingoism by adopting Canada and Mexico in a "Greater American Identity", the "national rebirth" via military coup has made the Legislative and Judiciary branches rife with corruption and Machiavellian power schemes at best, and glorified rubber stamps for the President and Joint Chiefs at worst. The Executive branch, despite having the best security on the continent, routinely had their administrations prematurely ended by assassination, leading many to believe even they are but a puppet to the military, and those who don't follow the whims of their generals will have their own security turn on them like the Praetorians of Imperial Rome. Of course, how much of this is truth, and how much is anti-Central conspiracy theory, is ill-defined.\n\nWith President Cygan having finished his term in office, citing health concerns as the reason he won't run for reelection, the question of who will lead the Central government is once again open to debate.  The "ongoing crisis" has long since thrown any elections from the common citizenry out the window, most especially after the Districts, while in-theory still under Central administration, in-practice became effectively independent nation-states with little loyalty paid to Central beyond the bare minimum of lipservice.  Thus, the "Central Council" - the unofficial name for the roiling sea of politicians, lobbyists, officers and spies feuding for power - is convening to select a new President, and perhaps implement some broader government reforms to salvage what little control it has left.\n\nThis could be the opportunity for the spark of democracy to reignite...§ROr be snuffed out, once and for all.§!"

  PNM_luis_reyes: "Luis Segerra Reyes"
  PNM_luis_reyes_desc: "As the leader of the Patriot Party, Luis Segerra Reyes was widely known to be President Cygan’s de facto successor after the latter declined to run for reelection. Reyes worked in the Central District as its ruling Governor, despite having only earned his citizenship status from when Central made its abortive attempt to take Mexico in the 2170s. Fiercely loyal to his newfound country, Reyes believes that the Central District represents the true legitimate authority in North America, and should be developed as the supreme capitol of a unified continent.\n\nDuring his time as governor, Reyes has obtained significant influence among Central’s political and military elites. He has also attracted widespread popularity in the general public, who are taken in by his restorationist rhetoric and self-styled image as the only leader strong enough to lead their decaying nation back to his former glory. With the power of Central behind him, Reyes is determined to return America to its superpower status, no matter the cost."

  PNM_wesley_forrest: "Wesley Forrest"
  PNM_wesley_forrest_desc: "Emerging as a dark horse in the race to replace Cygan, Wesley Forrest and his Elysium Party have managed to secure a surprising amount of support in the labyrinthine oligarchy of the Central Council. One of the youngest party leaders in Central’s history, Forrest grew up as part of the privileged upper class that had access to pre-Mistake history, culture, and even samples of preserved flora and fauna. More idealistic than past candidates, he wishes to restore democratic institutions in the Central government and take decisive action to regenerate America’s fading biospheres.\n\nThis platform has earned him broad approval of the masses, though it was much more pragmatic political maneuvering that carried the Elysium Party to prominence. Even so, Forrest’s ascension has made him many outspoken enemies within Central’s assorted internal cliques. Many within the Council suspect that Forrest is being puppeted by the Joint Chiefs to shore up crumbling public support and ecological conditions, and that he will be disposed of should any of his proposed reforms truly threaten their power. His own followers remain hopeful that he will yet succeed, even if it means fighting for the very soul of the NAU."
