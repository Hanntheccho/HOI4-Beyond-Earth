 GER_lena_ebner: "Lena Ebner"
 GER_lena_ebner_desc: "Born in Berlin to a German diplomat and a Polish teacher, Lena was raised as a "child of the world". Over the course of 15 years, she lived on four continents and learned to speak eight languages.\n\nLena fought fearlessly for refugee rights throughout central and eastern Europe. Her early work at the Braungart-Wissel Foundation for Environmental Law garnered her acclaim, and she was soon seen as an emerging leader of sustainability and the environmental policymaking. As she became a prominent lawyer-activist in post-Mistake Europe, Lena was an increasingly easy target for Franco-Iberian politicians. Painted as a desperate anarchist, Lena's non-traditional lifestyle and worldview was frequently highlighted in order to polarize moderates. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR.\n\nIt wasn't until Lena's most vocal and harshest critic (and cousin), Élodie, began her campaign for Franco-Iberian politics that Lena's vision for a transmodernist society crystallized. Transmodernism meant xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."
 GER_eva_rosenfeld: "Eva Rosenfeld"
 GER_eva_rosenfeld_desc: "For untold millennia, humanity has lived in harmony with the environment around it, taking what is necessary and giving back what it can.\n\nTo Eva Rosenfeld, life is complicated but doesn't need to be as complicated as it is. She initially studied to be a Historian, absorbing recounts of events long since passed, eventually climbing to be a Professor of History at the University of Leipzig. Everything from prehistory, to the birth of civilisation in Mesopotamia, and the middle ages became her drive, even studying what has been affectionately titled "The Golden Days" of humanity which brought forth immense technological growth as well as its most insufferable, ecological hubris. Years of studying humanity in its most natural state contrasted with the dying artificial state it has now suspended itself in, then broke the hopeful scholar.\n\nDrowning in grief, she began writing her Magnum Opus, the culmination of her new worldview, "The Rights of the Earth". The book was panned by the academic community for being unscientific and more of a manifesto but became a massive hit after INTEGR publicly endorsed it, parading it as a masterpiece of progressive thought.\n\nNow an official affiliate with INTEGR, Prof. Rosenfeld thus champions an agrarian and simplistic lifestyle, free from the crooked nature of industrial life, a life in touch with the spirit of the land and its creatures. Although many question her state of mind, it is without doubt her thoughts have strung a chord with the people."
 GER_eugen_langer: "Eugen Langer"
 GER_eugen_langer_desc: "Of the INTEGR faction, few are as calculated and collected as the elusive Eugen Langer. A certified genius and researcher from the Berlin Research Institute, Eugen prefers to observe the world through a very specific wavelength.\n\nInitially beginning as a chemistry student, Langer's academic life exploded into numerous fields of research, eventually collecting himself 5 PhDs, and publishing more than 30 papers in fields such as Particle Physics, Organic Chemistry and Bioengineering. Renowned for his intellect and feared for his cold attitude towards others, he made few friends during this period of his life, instead sticking close to immediate family.\n\nSadly however, a brutal blow would be dealt to this stability. Langer watched as his father, his most cherished friend and only remaining parent, died painfully from a treatable infection of the lungs. Discovering that budget cuts had been made to the health department for the sake of increased welfare payments, his formally stoic and logical mind was brought to anger and frustration.\n\nTo Langer, the "free" democratic system was revealed to be a paper-thin façade for the ineptocratic mess that was led by a weak and imprudent mass mentality, incapable of leading humanity into the future. INTEGR was therefore the best alternative, a group of alternate-thinking individuals who see that a shift in gear is necessary to prepare for the future. Joining at the first opportunity, his systematic diligence and hard work paid off, forming his own Sophistocratic faction, idolising a scholar-led society. While Langer is certainly no politician, his branch of INTEGR is understandably the most feared for having a true genius at the helm."

Much remains to be done, but many hope that its leaders will be up to the task.\n\nIntegration and legal parity between countries is the way to harmony in Europe... and eventually, the planet at large.\n\n§LOn the edge of the abyss, Europe once again manages to emerge from a dark period. The sun's light shines with hope, its rays no longer burn as they used to. Europe is at last being reborn green - the colour of faith.

############ EVENTS ###########

 german_event.1.t: "Our Future"
 german_event.1.d: "Germany is nearing its next election. Our country's democracy works through an effectively one-party system - every single registered politician with any sway is a part of INTEGR, which prevents our progressive agenda from being moved backwards, while allowing political pluralism. Even though some principles are shared across all the candidates, such as cosmopolitanism, green economy, and general aim for rapid progress, different wings of INTEGR have wildly varying plans beyond that.\n\nLena Ebner leads the orthodox faction. Fulfilling her personal doctrine of transmodernism, Lena strives to create a harmonious union between past and the present, balance between ecology and technological progress. Despite all her tolerance Ebner is far from a dove, and will not shy away from using force to expand her influence and safeguard Germany.\n\nEva Rosenfeld, our second major candidate, is a historian by trade, but an ecologist by calling. Her agenda focuses on deepening our bonds with nature and moving to an agrarian way of life. Eva's almost religious zeal towards her cause managed to attract both ardent supporters and cynical critics - whatever the outcome of the election will be, Rosenfeld will remain a large centre of attention during and after it.\n\nLast but not least, Eugen Langer. Leader of self-named Sophistocrats. A genius possessing numerous doctorates, Langer's goal is unrestricted scientific progress, and a society led by the brightest minds of Germany. He perceives democracy of the masses as an ineffective and hypocritical government type, and most likely will suspend it if elected, or even replace it altogether. Highly controversial and lacking political skills, Eugen is the dark horse of INTEGR, but important and influential nonetheless.\n\nIn the end, the results of this election will change Germany, Europe, and perhaps, even the whole world altogether. And even though it may change, right now our future is decided first and foremost by our populace."
 german_event_option.1.a: "The German people favour Lena Ebner"

 german_event_option.1.c: "The German people favour Eugen Langer"
 german_event.2.t: "RE: Our New Allies"
 german_event.2.d: ""Reports from England, sir."\nForeign Advisor Tobias Monaher let out a brief sigh. "What have those fools gotten up to now? Must we spend our entire budget on cleaning up after those muppets?" Tobias rolled his eyes, bracing himself for the report.\n"Spring Party control has been established across England, the last vestiges of resistance in Sussex and Wales are being cleaned up by the Springist militia. For all intents and purposes, the Spring Party has won the English Civil War."\n\nA large cheer went up around the German foreign office, every iota of air filled with jubilance and relief. "Alright everyone, I've been saving something for just this occasion." Another large cheer filled the office, whoops and hurrahs bouncing from cubicle wall to cubicle wall. The man grabbed a large bottle of champagne from the office safe and began waving it around. "3, 2, 1..." Pop! Members of the office began holding out their cups, waiting to recieve the fruits of up to a year's hard work.\n\n"Calm down everyone, don't celebrate just yet." Tobias jammed the cork back into the bottle of champagne. "Anyone who thinks this is the end of our England troubles, you would be mistaken. Anyone working here will be familiar with this woman." Tobias pointed to a picture of Cassie Kenney on the office's Holo-Schirm. "This is Cassandra 'Cassie' Kenney and she is the leader of the INTEGR-friendly faction in England. One might think this would make her more compliant, but she has proven to be quite the unflinching radical."\nA woman at the back of the room tentatively raised her hand. "Our diplomats seemed able to effectively talk with her and her advisors during the war. Why should anything change now?" \n"We were giving them guns, Sandra, guns to fight a war. Would you go against someone protecting your life?" Tobias clicked a remote in his hand and a new picture appeared on the Holo-Schirm. "These are messages we have been receiving from Spring Party higher-ups. I know we are German, but not even we use this many capital letters. Let's have a look at the demands here... more funding, more guns, more engineers, the works."\nAnother hand bolted up "As you said, sir, isn't this just wartime desperation?"\n"This isn't just wartime desperation, they keep mentioning some large project called 'The English Spring.' This looks to be a project that'd empty the coffers of China, let alone Germany. A project that'd pump unfathomable amounts of resources into revitalising a country that, let's be honest, can't be trusted with a knife and fork without turning it into a scandal." Tobias put his fingers on the bridge of his nose before giving his final orders. "If any English official asks for more money, resources, whatever, try to find a way to talk them down without disrespecting them. We can not afford to give the English what they want, but we must keep them in INTEGR, as much as they want to stake their own claims."\n\n"Also, one other thing...""
 german_event_option.2.a: "...save the Champagne. We'll need it for later."
 german_event.3.t: "War in Scandinavia!"
 german_event.3.d: "Our northern neighbours, countries of Scandinavia have largely been stable and neutral for most of their history, even before the Great Mistake. Not counting the extreme flooding and political collapse that led Denmark to joining Germany relatively recently. Unfortunately the status-quo was broken by Norway’s invasion into Sweden. As a long-time member of the NSA, Norway is our direct geopolitical rival and must be stopped at every opportunity, or at the very least forced to pay a heavy price for its expansion - not even counting the fact that Norway’s justification ranges from weak to downright absurd, and is a thinly-veiled excuse for imperialism. It is obvious that we should intervene - albeit we are walking on a tightrope between two pitfalls. Sweden losing its war and independence, or our efforts igniting too much tensions in Europe. After long consideration, we decide to…"
 german_event_option.3.a: "Do nothing..."
 german_event_option.3.b: "Small-arms and ammunition will be enough"
 german_event_option.3.c: "They’ll require both men and arms"
 german_event_option.3.d: "This war must be stopped by all means, directly intervene."
 german_event.4.t: "61/1999"
 german_event.4.d: "Lena Ebner held a speech in the Bundestag today:\n"Germany welcomed millions of refugees when the oceans started swallowing up metropolises. We accepted millions more when other governments drowned under the pressures of the Great Mistake. We have never forgotten the mistakes of the 20th century, and accepted our responsibility to be better. It has never been easy. And there's still more coming, every day, seeking the beacon of justice and righteousness that we have erected.\n\nMost of those refugees are part of our society now, and we are proud of them. Thanks in no small part to them, we are now in a better position than ever to tackle the problems of the future. The Dark Days are over! And that means looking forward, as we've always done, as I've promised to continue doing, looking at ways we can serve our citizens - and the world!\n\nAnd that requires us to confront those whom we have failed. Because despite everything we've done so far, not every refugee is happy. Not all of them housed, fed, safe. You've all seen the images of the container cities slowly succumbing to mud and squalor. This must be unacceptable to us. It certainly is to me.\nAnd naturally these people we've let down are starting to look to other saviours - the North Sea Alliance chiefly amongst them. And the NSA has great plans. But do those plans really have their best interest at heart, or are they monuments to human hybris? It is understandable that these plans fascinate some people, Especially those nostalgic for their old coastal nations. But they are not the way forward.\nWe should take this as a warning sign that we need to be careful not to become complacent in our efforts.\n\nAnd every person that falls through the cracks is a person whose potential we are wasting. It will take all of us to fix the mistakes of our ancestors, the mistakes we, as humanity, are still making every day. Every scientist, engineer, nurse and teacher counts. We cannot afford to squander their lives.\n\nTherefore, I am asking you to approve ordinance 61/1999. It covers streamlining the asylum process, improving refugee access to welfare payments, expanding virtual classrooms, and more money for safety and health inspection in the settlements. It also allows for more in-depth data collection systems to measure the impact of these policies qualitatively.\nI'm also calling for us to appreciate the outstanding work that the local volunteer's corps are doing. Not only are they at the forefront of providing stable housing to the needy, they have also provided invaluable know-how during our fact-finding. I think their efforts deserve more recognition, and 61/1999 will also lower bureaucratic hurdles and streamline the funding process for them.\n\nLet us show them what INTEGR can do for them!""
 german_event_option.4.a: "Ordinance 61/1999 was approved unanimously."
 german_event.5.t: "An Unexpected Visitor"
 german_event.5.d: ""Hey you, are you lost?"\nThe woman bending down over Ruben's small statue has piercingly pale eyes, but they aren't cold as you'd expect, they are anything but that. His own face, in contrast, is muddy from playing in the streets, which really don't deserve that name. The only exception are two clear streaks where his tears have washed it. The boy stares at her in fascination, completely forgetting to actually answer the question. She smiles beatifically, holding out a hand. "Come on, I'll walk you home. Where do you live?" The boy hesitates for only a second before taking her hand. "C-Container 30, row Z4. Er, C4," he corrects himself. "It's hard to remember, I get them mixed up a lot. That's why I don't know where to go... There's no signs." He's about to burst into tears again. The woman squeezes his hand. "Don't worry, we'll get you home."\n\nA short while later they arrive, knocking at the container house's door - or rather the sheet metal that's taking the place where a door should be. Ruben's mother opens it and her face lights up as she sees her son returned home safe. "There you are, you little rascal!" she says, with a heavy dutch accent. Only then does she realise she doesn't know who it is that brought her wayward son home. Her eyes wander to the INTEGR pin on the guest's jacket. Then they wander to the posters providing splotches of colour to the rust walls of the shipping container: Duncan Hughes' stark profile, glorious shots of ARKs, in short - North Sea Alliance propaganda. And the woman's relief at having her son returned turns into dread. The woman smiles at her, trying to put her at ease. "Don't worry, please. You have nothing to fear. This is serendipitous, actually. I'm here to talk about..." she nods towards one of the posters. "That, actually. Wanted to see it with my own eyes. I just need to understand. The NSA aren't our friends. They aren't yours, either. So why? Why do my people keep telling me there are more and more of you supporting their ideas?"\n\nRuben's mother sighs. "Take a look around you. What is there for us here? Worse yet, what's there for him?" She ruffles her son's hair.\nEva nods thoughtfully. She's seen the 'No Future' graffitoed across the settlement's walls. "It's cruel. Like a plant denied space to grow up. I promise you, I'll do my best to fix this. I have an idea for how to start already."\nShe bends down so that she is level with Ruben's. "Something for you." She gingerly places a collection of earthen balls into his hand. He smells the clay, and asks: "What's that?"\n"The future in ten grams: Seed balls! They've got everything a plant needs to thrive. Plant this, take care of it, and one seed becomes ten, a hundred, a forest. Remember where we met? If you planted a few of these there, the playground won't be so full of mud after every rain, and you won't get lost anymore if there's trees to show the way. Share a few of them with your friends, too. Making more is easy, we'll teach you. And then you can teach them. And they can teach theirs, and together you'll create an oasis here that people will want to live in."\n\nRuben carefully puts the balls into his pocket. "I don't get it, who are you? Who just walks around with seed balls in their pockets?"\n"I'm Eva Rosenfeld. And I want to create a better future. Will you help me?""
 german_event_option.5.a: "We'll need to to do much more, but this a good start."
 german_event.6.t: "The Baltic Problem"
 german_event.6.d: "Terrible news - in the process of standing up for their fellow citizens fed up by wasteful spending, the Baltic Union military massacred INTEGR activists! A minute of silence for the dead was held in the Bundestag and memorial rallies have been held in all major cities.\n\nWe have considered taking direct action on this, but risk-benefit analysis flagged up some considerable tail risk in escalating tensions with the entire North Sea Alliance. Instead, the Federal Foreign Office has proposed that we support our Polish allies as the vanguard, keeping any conflict regional and minimising risk of escalation.\n\nWe didn't really expect this, as the Poles have been quite... complacent in the past century, but it seems that their INTEGR leadership has finally relit the fire in their belly, and they've already strongly condemned the Baltic Unions actions. They've shared their plans for a peacekeeping operation with us. Laudable initiative. Even better - it means we don't even have to exert any pressure to get what we want!\n\nThe planning office estimates that supplying Poland with modern infantry kits has the highest cost-benefit ratio. Our army isn't all too happy about giving up that equipment, though."
 german_event_option.6.a: "Let them deal with it on their own."
 german_event_option.6.b: "Send the Polish some equipment!"
 german_event.7.t: "The Heer Steps In"
 german_event.7.d: "The escalating situation in Europe has lead to increasing amounts of unrest in the general populace and even INTEGR itself, with the war now being fought on two fronts due to the Eurasian Union's entry into the conflict. Some officials in the Federal Army have also raised concerns about our chances of achieving a decisive victory. One Leopold Geißler, a General in the Heer, and his clique of officers have come forth to the General Secretary and proposed a drastic plan: the Military would assume control of the government to see Germany to the end of the war. While General Geißler has promised the General Secretary that these measures would only be temporary, once the Heer has taken over the government we might not have a say in the matter anymore.\n\nSome might say that effectively handing control of the country to a military junta is betraying INTEGR's cause. Others might call it traitorous. However, soon we may longer be in a position to reject their proposal."
 german_event_option.7.a: "Desperate times call for desperate measures."
 german_event_option.7.b: "This is insanity! Somoene stop those maniacs!"
 german_event.8.t: "[?global.just_joined_integr^0.GetName] joins the INTEGR!"
 german_event.8.d: "The borders of Europe are redrawn once again, as INTEGR, the power bloc headed by the German Federation, gains a new member. This new member state has caused INTEGR's already sizeable influence in Europe to grow considerably. Following a brief acceptance ceremony, INTEGR political leadership promised economic and military aid to its newest member. Though INTEGR participant nations celebrate this victory, voices of dissent have spoken out against it. With some going so far as to state it is little more than a parody of the Zollverein, the Prussian lead Customs Union that planted the economic roots needed for German Unification in the 19th century."
 german_event_option.8.a: "Unity is strength..."
 german_event.9.t: "Fall Schwarz"
 german_event.9.d: "When we declared the Provisional Military Government, the enemies were at the gates of our country. INTEGR as an institution across Europe was rapidly crumbling, our allies were failing to contain the invading hordes of the West, East, and the Sea. We were ready to prime the country to the defense of the fatherland.\n\nThis time is different. The INTEGR failed us. The gates to our country have been broken down. Our allies were slaughtered in the meat grinder that is this war. Our soil has been encroached on by enemies from all sides - seeking to slaughter our people and home. Therefore, every man, woman, and child must fight to defend and save our country. All our remaining industry must be totally geared towards the final defense of our country.\n\nIf we fail to muster this final defense, we fail our people, our ideals, what we have been fighting this entire war for. We have no time running society - only time to fight unto death. There is only war. Total War."
 german_event_option.9.a: "We will not go down quietly!"
 german_event_option.9.b: "There is nothing that can be done."

 GER_anti_franco_iberian_desc: "Lena Ebner represents a watershed moment in the history of post-Mistake Europe. An event of this magnitude occurs only once a generation. Billed as "a response to the new imperialism", what actually this means is nothing less than a cogent new political philosophy, neither right nor left, dominionist nor green. A strong posture against Franco-Iberian agenda."
 GER_transhumanism_desc: "The "aristocratic spirit of seriousness" and "ancien regime of Western rationalistic technocracy" have motivated the politics of this age, with the agents of the state and entertainment serving as gatekeepers for what is "good" and what is "bad" for the people. Transmodernism means xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."
 GER_green_austerity_desc: "Lena bridged the gap between technocrat, activist, and environmentalist. In fact, it was Lena herself who suggested the Party restructure their organization under those three verticals. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR."

For this reason the "Green Soil" plan was signed by these three countries in 2194 with the aim of maintaining a dynamic, mutually supportive and green economy.\n\nSince then, relations between the three countries have only improved. In both countries the Initiative has great social support and is seen as the future of the region and of Europe as a whole.\n\nThe reality is that this treaty has led to an interdependence between the signatory countries, where if the economy of one were to fall, the economy of the other would be seriously affected. That is why the engagement between these countries will be long-lasting and prosperous, as long as the ambitions of European leaders do not get in the way."
