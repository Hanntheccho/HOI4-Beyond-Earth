 COG_andre_ilunga: "Andre Ilunga"
 COG_andre_ilunga_desc: "The dissolution of the African Union was a bloody and confusing affair. Known under many names, the Congolese call it 'Lumbu ya kimpwanza' or 'Day of Freedom', the East Africans know it as the 'Talaka' or 'Divorce'.\n\nAndre Ilunga, Leader of the now-independent Congo, calls it a god-send.\n\nBorn in 2151, on the year of the independent Congo's inception, he watched as every man and woman in his city joined up to local militias, fighting for an independent state, free from a homogenising and overbearing union. However his people were not fighting the African Union, but the Congo state itself, all in an attempt to establish a state for the Luba people. The nationalistic fire that the Lumbu ya kimpwanza started could not be put out.\n\nAs he grew up, Andre moved to the megacity of Kinshasa, studied history and political science, slowly becoming disillusioned with his Luba kin's idea of freedom. Freedom was not freedom to fight whoever you want, or to pursue self-interest. Freedom is the ability to feel safe doing whatever you want, to practice whatever faith, speak whichever language and to change yourself in whichever way possible.\n\nAndre became Mayor of Kinshasa in 2180 and Ntuadusi of Congo in 2185, and began a project turning it into a land of freedom, men and women walked around with augments on display, a cross around their neck and a police camera watching their every move. What is freedom if not to feel safe from those who would take it away? Andre knows that at any moment, the EAF would be happy to take it away."
