  SIB_the_siberian_nation_desc:0 "The Siberian Republic was born from the ashes of a failed dream. The Republican Revolution of 2156 hoped to overthrow the corrupt Eurasian government, but infighting and a lack of initiative killed the spark. The remnants of the Revolution have fled here, to the Siberian wastes. Living not too differently from the dead, harassed by Chinese guerillas and overflowing with immigrants - but we will survive."

  SIB_the_siberian_blood_desc:0 "Brave sons and daughters of old Russia, arise to retake your motherland! The vile Eurasian Union plots in the dark, preying on the innocents of Moscow. To the South, the Chinese hordes threaten to overrun our border. The enemy lies within, mincing away at the heart of our nation, preparing to slay us all. Arise! Glory to the Revolution! Glory to Democracy! Glory to the Republic!"

  SIB_japanese_imports_desc:0 "The Japanese have survived the Great Mistake and Dark Ages relatively intact. Famed for their mobile mercenary forces, we are unfortunately too poor right not to afford them. However, in exchange for some transportation fees and resource rights, we can import newer Japanese weapons to deal with the insurgency."

  SIB_redevelop_magadan_desc:0 "The port city of Magadan serves as an influx point for foreign weaponry and supplies. By handing out tax cuts to local businesses and funding sinking enterprises in the city, we can rapidly develop Magadan, ensuring a greater inflow of goods into Siberia."
