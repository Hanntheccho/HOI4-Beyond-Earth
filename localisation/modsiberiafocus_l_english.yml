  SIB_the_siberian_nation:0 "The Siberian Nation"
  SIB_the_siberian_nation_desc:0 "The Siberian Republic was born from the ashes of a failed dream. The Republican Revolution of 2156 hoped to overthrow the corrupt Eurasian government, but infighting and a lack of initiative killed the spark. The remnants of the Revolution have fled here, to the Siberian wastes. Living not too differently from the dead, harassed by Chinese guerillas and overflowing with immigrants - but we will survive."

  SIB_the_siberian_blood:0 "The Siberian Blood"
  SIB_the_siberian_blood_desc:0 "Brave sons and daughters of old Russia, arise to retake your motherland! The vile Eurasian Union plots in the dark, preying on the innocents of Moscow. To the South, the Chinese hordes threaten to overrun our border. The enemy lies within, mincing away at the heart of our nation, preparing to slay us all. Arise! Glory to the Revolution! Glory to Democracy! Glory to the Republic!"

  SIB_japanese_imports:0 "Japanese Imports"
  SIB_japanese_imports_desc:0 "The Japanese have survived the Great Mistake and Dark Ages relatively intact. Famed for their mobile mercenary forces, we are unfortunately too poor right not to afford them. However, in exchange for some transportation fees and resource rights, we can import newer Japanese weapons to deal with the insurgency."

  SIB_redevelop_magadan:0 "Redevelop Magadan"
  SIB_redevelop_magadan_desc:0 "The port city of Magadan serves as an influx point for foreign weaponry and supplies. By handing out tax cuts to local businesses and funding sinking enterprises in the city, we can rapidly develop Magadan, ensuring a greater inflow of goods into Siberia."

  SIB_the_siberian_legacy:0 "The Siberian Legacy"
  SIB_the_siberian_legacy_desc:0 "It is a common error, to mistake the existence of Siberia as being due to some glorified independence movement, throwing off the shackles of Eurasia to pave a new path. In truth, the Siberian Republic is more of a government in exile - the fallout of the Republican Revolution, combined with mass Chinese migration, spelled doom for any hope of Eurasia reclaiming the East in the 22nd century. The Siberians are really just Russians and Chinese, but together, there may be hope for a new Revolution yet."

  SIB_placate_immigrants:0 "Placate Immigrants"
  SIB_placate_immigrants_desc:0 "As much as we hate to admit it, the Chinese immigrants are here to stay. Our ethics (and pragmatism) oblige us to grant some of them representation, so we might as well get these newcomers on our side. Some propaganda, promises, bribes and stabs should be sufficient to override nationalist sentiment in the Chinese minority… for now."

  SIB_irkutsk_digital_printing_facility:0 "Irkutsk Digital-Printing Facility"
  SIB_irkutsk_digital_printing_facility_desc:0 "Every new citizen requires proper documentation. Unfortunately, the state of the forests and limited foreign imports have bottlenecked paper production. We must resort to digital catalogs and collective databases (as unreliable and prone to sabotage as they are) to keep track of our rapidly swelling population. There is an inactive Digital-Printing Facility here in Irkutsk, which we can retrofit with modern computers to serve as a central network node for population and individual statistics."
