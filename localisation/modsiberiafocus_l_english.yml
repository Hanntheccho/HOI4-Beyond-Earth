  SIB_the_siberian_nation:0 "The Siberian Nation"
  SIB_the_siberian_nation_desc:0 "The Siberian Republic was born from the ashes of a failed dream. The Republican Revolution of 2156 hoped to overthrow the corrupt Eurasian government, but infighting and a lack of initiative killed the spark. The remnants of the Revolution have fled here, to the Siberian wastes. Living not too differently from the dead, harassed by Chinese guerillas and overflowing with immigrants - but we will survive."

  SIB_the_siberian_blood:0 "The Siberian Blood"
  SIB_the_siberian_blood_desc:0 "Brave sons and daughters of old Russia, arise to retake your motherland! The vile Eurasian Union plots in the dark, preying on the innocents of Moscow. To the South, the Chinese hordes threaten to overrun our border. The enemy lies within, mincing away at the heart of our nation, preparing to slay us all. Arise! Glory to the Revolution! Glory to Democracy! Glory to the Republic!"

  SIB_japanese_imports:0 "Japanese Imports"
  SIB_japanese_imports_desc:0 "The Japanese have survived the Great Mistake and Dark Ages relatively intact. Famed for their mobile mercenary forces, we are unfortunately too poor right not to afford them. However, in exchange for some transportation fees and resource rights, we can import newer Japanese weapons to deal with the insurgency."

  SIB_redevelop_magadan:0 "Redevelop Magadan"
  SIB_redevelop_magadan_desc:0 "The port city of Magadan serves as an influx point for foreign weaponry and supplies. By handing out tax cuts to local businesses and funding sinking enterprises in the city, we can rapidly develop Magadan, ensuring a greater inflow of goods into Siberia."

  SIB_the_siberian_legacy:0 "The Siberian Legacy"
  SIB_the_siberian_legacy_desc:0 "It is a common error, to mistake the existence of Siberia as being due to some glorified independence movement, throwing off the shackles of Eurasia to pave a new path. In truth, the Siberian Republic is more of a government in exile - the fallout of the Republican Revolution, combined with mass Chinese migration, spelled doom for any hope of Eurasia reclaiming the East in the 22nd century. The Siberians are really just Russians and Chinese, but together, there may be hope for a new Revolution yet."

  SIB_placate_immigrants:0 "Placate Immigrants"
  SIB_placate_immigrants_desc:0 "As much as we hate to admit it, the Chinese immigrants are here to stay. Our ethics (and pragmatism) oblige us to grant some of them representation, so we might as well get these newcomers on our side. Some propaganda, promises, bribes and stabs should be sufficient to override nationalist sentiment in the Chinese minority… for now."

  SIB_irkutsk_digital_printing_facility:0 "Irkutsk Digital-Printing Facility"
  SIB_irkutsk_digital_printing_facility_desc:0 "Every new citizen requires proper documentation. Unfortunately, the state of the forests and limited foreign imports have bottlenecked paper production. We must resort to digital catalogs and collective databases (as unreliable and prone to sabotage as they are) to keep track of our rapidly swelling population. There is an inactive Digital-Printing Facility here in Irkutsk, which we can retrofit with modern computers to serve as a central network node for population and individual statistics."

  SIB_majority_crackdown:0 "Majority Crackdown"
  SIB_majority_crackdown_desc:0 "The situation is dire, and we desperately need more control over insurgent Chinese elements. However, government crackdowns are quite unpopular and can backfire by making our own people sympathize with the immigrants. Instead, we should utilize propaganda and covertly fund nationalist groups, to carry out domestic terror attacks for us. We aren’t saints but we do what we must. For the survival of our people and Revolution."

  SIB_smear_the_reds:0 "Smear The Reds"
  SIB_smear_the_reds_desc:0 "The red menace has returned to Russia. Socialist movements, while quite unpopular in the developer West, are nearly countless here in Siberia, where living conditions are almost as bad as in distant India. We cannot afford a split in Russian unity, especially if the red traitors start preaching fully equal voting privileges for undocumented Chinese."

  SIB_memories_of_the_union:0 "Memories Of The Union"
  SIB_memories_of_the_union_desc:0 "The socialist cause idolizes the ancient Soviet Union. Although it has faded into myth for many, the Reds remind the lower classes of a society that treats everybody equally, is completely democratic, and allows free enterprise for those with the will to succeed. We cannot allow these lies to spread. We must utilize our television networks and nodes to remind the people of the Union’s brutality towards its own people - a past that should stay buried in the mists of time."

  SIB_memories_of_the_republic:0 "Memories Of The Republic"
  SIB_memories_of_the_republic_desc:0 "The Republican Revolution was the greatest event in modern Russian history. The culmination of decades of hard work on part of brave men and women, wiped away by bad luck. But the dream lives on, here in Siberia. Our people are the inheritors of this great legacy, it is their debt to reclaim Russia and they must be reminded of the future we all so rightly deserve."

  SIB_allocate_rural_subsidies:0 "Allocate Rural Subsidies"
  SIB_allocate_rural_subsidies_desc:0 "Although the Reds draw their support from urban areas, their position there is too solidified to root out right now. Instead, we should focus on establishing a clear popular front in the countryside, which houses the vast majority of Siberia’s population. By handing out welfare checks and helping rural communities, we can not only develop neglected regions, but also add to our party’s support."

  SIB_watch_the_border:0 "Watch The Border"
  SIB_watch_the_border_desc:0 "Our border with China is porous at best, and borderline non-existent at worst; that is to say, most border guards have been withdrawn inland for policing duties, thereby allowing millions of refugees to enter Siberia. To mend this situation, we will have to reestablish clear patrol schedules, erect pillboxes and lookout towers across the Southern mountain range and contact the Chinese authorities to resolve our common problem."

  SIB_people_for_guns:0 "People For Guns"
  SIB_people_for_guns_desc:0 "The deal is simple. We give the Chinese government their people back (collected via trucks, by force if necessary), and take care of any undesirables who are not worthy of returning South. In return, the Chinese will ship us some of their outdated equipment, filling in the many gaps in our army."

  SIB_joint_declaration_of_positive_intent:0 "Joint Declaration Of Positive Intent"
  SIB_joint_declaration_of_positive_intent_desc:0 "After our dealings, the Chinese government looks favorably upon us. We must capitalize on this opportunity and sign a series of trade and border agreements. Hopefully this cooperation will win over some of the immigrants to our side."

  SIB_harbin_irkutsk_route:0 "Harbin-Irkutsk Route"
  SIB_harbin_irkutsk_route_desc:0 "The Dragon of China has retreated into its cave, poisoned by internal forces and unlikely to ever come out. We should exploit the precarious situation in China: because it is obvious that civil war is inevitable, we can contact rogue elements of the Chinese army to establish a proper smuggling route into Siberia. Weapons, ammunition, suits, everything in return for some grain."

  SIB_raise_additional_patrols:0 "Raise Additional Patrols"
  SIB_raise_additional_patrols_desc:0 "The situation in China is getting worse by the day, and we must be ready for the inflow of tens of millions of refugees at a time. Additional patrols will need to be raised to guard the borders of our glorious Republic."

  SIB_reactivate_revolutionary_squads:0 "Reactivate Revolutionary Squads"
  SIB_reactivate_revolutionary_squads_desc:0 "When the Revolution fled East, army defectors came with us. So far, our economy could not keep up with the upkeep of having so many standing guards, but the times are dire. We should contact retired soldiers and press them back into service."

  SIB_minority_conscription_law:0 "Minority Conscription Law"
  SIB_minority_conscription_law_desc:0 "The Chinese outnumber us by the day. Ethnic Russians are no longer sufficient to man the entire width of the Chinese border, nor patrol every despicable slum in Siberia. We have to force through legislation permitting limited conscription of loyal Chinese into the army."

  SIB_loyal_chinese_brigades:0 "Loyal Chinese Brigades"
  SIB_loyal_chinese_brigades_desc:0 "As the situation grows dire, we must consider drafting an entire division manned and led by loyal Chinese immigrants. While this should give us some extra bodies to throw against the insurgency, we run the risk of rebel moles infiltrating the Chinese brigade."

  SIB_officer_reassignment_policy:0 "Officer Reassignment Policy"
  SIB_officer_reassignment_policy_desc:0 "Our problem is not the absence of guards and patrolmen, but their inadequacy in terms of training and experience. Ten untrained men are equal to one veteran. We should reassign our best officers away from the stealthy rebels and back to the barracks for training duties."

  SIB_cutting_ice:0 "Cutting Ice"
  SIB_cutting_ice_desc:0 "Our recent development of Magadan will have been for naught if we are unable to penetrate the thick fields of ice that have survived the Great Mistake and now blockade the Northeast. By attaching Icebreaker escorts to our transport ships, we will avoid any unnecessary accidents when it comes to shipping."

  SIB_irkutsk_aerodrome:0 "Irkutsk Aerodrome"
  SIB_irkutsk_aerodrome_desc:0 "Not all foreign supplies have to be delivered by sea. We can retrofit the old airport in Irkutsk itself and use heavy planes to trade for much-needed medical supplies into the city."

  SIB_lower_production_standards:0 "Lower Production Standards"
  SIB_lower_production_standards_desc:0 "Our factory workers are doing as much as they can to rapidly arm our tiny military, but their efforts are still insufficient. We should cut down on regulations, allow the private production of military-grade materiel, and lower production minimums."

  SIB_anti_guerilla_expertise:0 "Anti-Guerilla Expertise"
  SIB_anti_guerilla_expertise_desc:0 "The Luo Zhenxian has finally been beaten. We are triumphant, and our soldiers have attained invaluable experience from rooting out insurgents."
