  KAR_forlorn_hope:0 "Forlorn Hope"
  KAR_forlorn_hope_desc:0 "The Republic of Russia lives! Denied our Revolution by the vile government in Moscow, self-exiled to frozen Karelia, destined to waste away… nay we say! With each passing day, Eurasia grows stronger, outpacing our already outdated military. But there is an opportunity…"

  KAR_fortress_karelia:0 "Fortress Karelia"
  KAR_fortress_karelia_desc:0 "While our inevitable war against Eurasia relies on offensive tactics, the lack of soldiers will make it difficult to push on multiple fronts. We must select one area to fortify and hold against the tide, and another to push through."

  KAR_refocus_the_market:0 "Refocus The Market"
  KAR_refocus_the_market_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Karelian peninsula lacks any sort of advanced economy. Our main exports are seafood to Scandenavian countries, and metals from the South. We will need to focus our economy on wartime production if we want to have any chance of beating Eurasia."

  KAR_magnetic_cranes:0 "Magnetic Cranes"
  KAR_magnetic_cranes_desc:0 "Construction is difficult on the peninsula. The cold temperatures greatly limit work hours, and clashes between Slavs and Finns often result in collateral damage. We should import some magnetic construction cranes from Europe to assist in reconstruction efforts.  "

  KAR_gun_running:0 "Gun Running"
  KAR_gun_running_desc:0 "Some of our traders have contacted pirates and smugglers in the North Atlantic. We can capitalize on this opportunity to import stolen infantry equipment and weapons from Western Europe and North America."

  KAR_our_siberian_brothers:0 "Our Siberian Brothers"
  KAR_our_siberian_brothers_desc:0 "The bravest of our traders have found a safe route through the North, into Siberia, where the rest of the Revolutionaries are. Although this safe route is quite long and difficult to navigate, we can still rely on this connection to import old rifles and equipment."

  KAR_local_gun_smiths:0 "Local Gun Smiths"
  KAR_local_gun_smiths_desc:0 "We are suffering from a lack of ammunition and working firearms. We must focus our limited worker pool on producing equipment for our soldiers."

  KAR_murmansk_autoplant:0 "Murmansk AutoPlant"
  KAR_murmansk_autoplant_desc:0 "Wars today are won by superior maneuvering. However, we lack the means by which to create a mobile strike force. Some wealthy defectors from Eurasia are pooling their funds to open a tractor factory in Murmansk. We should send them subsidies and cut taxes on military-related operations to boost equipment production."

  KAR_accelerated_walker_production:0 "Accelerated Walker Production"
  KAR_accelerated_walker_production_desc:0 "The elite of our armies consist of Walker divisions. Originally defectors from the Central Asian Campaign, these armored units are not quite as powerful as main battle tanks in the Eurasian plains, but they will have to do. All of our efforts should be invested into the Walkers, to lead the charge to Moscow."

  KAR_invite_resource_prospectors:0 "Invite Resource Prospectors"
  KAR_invite_resource_prospectors_desc:0 "Karelia is wealthy in natural resources, but most of them are hidden deep within the Earth. We can rely on foreign experts to construct boreholes and open new mines to boost our resource production."

  KAR_centralized_ammo_production:0 "Centralized Ammo Production"
  KAR_centralized_ammo_production_desc:0 "Currently, gunsmiths operate independently and without cohesion. We should draft an oversight board and help foster a community between gun makers to smoothen production."

  KAR_rally_the_russians:0 "Rally The Russians"
  KAR_rally_the_russians_desc:0 "Propaganda is a powerful tool. Some of our people are demoralized, still living in the fading past. We should use media channels to spread word of the upcoming Revolution!"

  KAR_tier_iv_service_training_sequence:0 "Tier IV Service Training Sequence"
  KAR_tier_iv_service_training_sequence_desc:0 "Due to our small numbers, we must rely on quality rather than quantity. The Europeans have come up with a set of Training Sequences, organized by tiers ranging from I to X, conscripts to elite agents respectfully. We should train foot troops with the Tier IV sequence, which includes harsh weather training, urban combat, rapid engagement and crowd control."

  KAR_tier_v_service_training_sequence:0 "Tier V Service Training Sequence"
  KAR_tier_v_service_training_sequence_desc:0 "Now that the Tier IV sequence is engrained in the soldiers’ mindset, we can promote high-achieving officers to the Tier V training sequence. This includes woodland and mountain training, naval duties, aircraft piloting and long-distance combat."

  KAR_rally_the_finns:0 "Rally The Finns"
  KAR_rally_the_finns_desc:0 "Some say that it is not their fight. The Finnish immigrants are just observers in the conflict between Russia and Eurasia. This is false. By living within the borders of the rightful Russia, the Finnish immigrants should be required to serve in the military. These conscripts are too unreliable to fight on the frontlines, but can fill auxiliary roles."

  KAR_make_promises:0 "Make Promises"
  KAR_make_promises_desc:0 "Our Revolution is built on the will of the people. If they forsake Republican leadership, our powerbase will crumble. To avoid this fate, we can make wild promises to raise spirits and encourage further military enlistment."

  KAR_memories_of_home:0 "Memories Of Home"
  KAR_memories_of_home_desc:0 "This is a great struggle! We must return to our homeland, slay this Eurasian abomination, and restore the proper Russian Republic. Although many of our people have been denied access to the homeland of their ancestors, they are nonetheless eager to take it back."
