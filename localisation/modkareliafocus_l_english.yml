  KAR_forlorn_hope:0 "Forlorn Hope"
  KAR_forlorn_hope_desc:0 "The Republic of Russia lives! Denied our Revolution by the vile government in Moscow, self-exiled to frozen Karelia, destined to waste away… nay we say! With each passing day, Eurasia grows stronger, outpacing our already outdated military. But there is an opportunity…"

  KAR_our_siberian_brothers_desc:0 "The bravest of our traders have found a safe route through the North, into Siberia, where the rest of the Revolutionaries are.
