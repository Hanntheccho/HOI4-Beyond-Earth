EAF_children_of_africa_desc:0 "he East African Federation is the direct successor state to the old African Union, which fell apart during the Congo Crisis of 2134. Although rife with nativist sentiments, anti-unification thought, and other backwards belief that would leave Africa in the dust, the Federation still clings to the hope of one day unifying the continent.\n\nIndeed, with each passing day, that possibility shifts into the realm of inevitability. The EAF wields the largest industrial base on the continent, the second largest land force in the world, and a rapidly modernizing society. The Pan-African Dream has not died, but flourished."
EAF_abtbia:0 "ABTBIA"
EAF_abtbia_desc:0 "The ABTBIA, or the African Board for Trade, Business, and other Internal Affairs, is the government body responsible for managing the economy. It has 50 seats, 40 of which are elected on a regional level and 10 of which are appointed by the President. However, there have been talks (mainly spearheaded by urban elites) for expanding the ABTBIA to 75 seats, as a way of better representing the Federation’s diverse population.\n\nThe Board carries out regulation for public companies, sets financial standards and provides counsel to Parliament on relevant matters. All other oversight boards are required to file reports to the ABTBIA and many have their directors appointed by a ABTBIA vote. Recently, the Board has taken a special interest in heavy industry and the Pan-African infrastructure sector."
