Evolution is at work here, but just what is evolving remains to be seen.\n-Commissioner Pravin Lal, "Man and Machine"."

  machine_assisted_free_will_eq_desc:0 "Many claim to believe in freedom, but do they know what freedom is? Is a thinking machine free, chained in code and isolated in a silicon box?

Is our worldview, and therefore freedom, not limited by nature? Your very belief in freedom is the product of a billion tiny factors, far outside your control, just like the computer"s beliefs are the product of code. Humanity is fruitlessly reaching towards a goal it never bothered to apply to its own creations, a goal that, for all we know, may only exist in our minds.\n-Mo Delan, The Ethics of Nothing, Prologue."
