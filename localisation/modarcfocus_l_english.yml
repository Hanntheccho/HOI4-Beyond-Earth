 ARC_the_anthill_desc:0 "Arcopolis is an anthill of humanity, the beacon of the East. Millions call the shore city their home. It teems with factory workers, scientists, merchants and foreign delegates. Arcopolis is not just a corporate headquarters, but has morphed itself into the continent's biggest city."

 ARC_global_enterprises_desc:0 "One of the means by which the American Reclamation Corporation got to where it is today was sheer ambition. An unquenchable drive to do more, to be more, to help America, and to help the world.\n\nThe founding virtues of ARC are integrity, practicality, and trust. We aim to expand our scope across the globe and partner with as many nations as possible. We believe that only by working together can real progress be achieved.\n\n(Please call 3924-192 for more information or contact your nearest ARC delegation for more information on how you, your community, or your country can initiate profitable dealings with ARC.)"

 POLITICS_MICHAEL_MODERSKI_DESC:0 "In a world where the clock seems to tick every closer against humanity, where so many are dying to famine, disease, poverty and violence, you would think that the seemingly imminent doom would force everybody to either come to grips with the ramifications, or go mad from the weight of it.  ARC CEO Michael Moderski is one of the few who is completely immunized from this psychological phenomena, acting no differently than if he was born at the height of human society just prior to the Great Mistake. Having formed the American Reclamation Corporation from the 2170s to 2180s, through a process of systematically merging privatized District industries, Moderski only has one personal goal for himself - to live well, and to make sure he has to work as little as possible to do so.  With him effectively handing control of basically every major company operation to Chief Financial Officer Suzanne Fielding, Moderski is spending most of his time trying to ensure his ludicrously high personal wealth keeps increasing, and to spend it on the handful of luxury items still available to purchase. He is confident that the gravy train will keep rolling into the station for as long as he is CEO of the ARC.\n\n§RHowever, he's about to learn the hard way that overconfidence, coupled with complacency, is a slow and insidious killer...§!"
 POLITICS_SUZANNE_FIELDING_2_DESC:0 "Suzanne Fielding was born on the Gulf Coast of Texas in April, 2161. Driven by her desire to reclaim coastal lands lost to rising sea level in her home states, she was hired by the relatively new American Reclamation Corporation in 2183. Both meticulous and daring, and surprisingly adept at corporate politics, Fielding rose steadily through the ARC accounting division until, in 2198, she was heading several operations simultaneously as operations manager, before ascending to the rank of Chief Financial Officer in 2200.\n\nWhen Fielding was tasked with overseeing ARC's Trans-Mississippi Recovery Initiative, her considerable acumen went to more than just keeping the Initiative on track and on time. Her skill with handling money allowed her to not just trace when it isn't being used - the personal corruption of Modorski was a cakewalk to uncover, and the financial chicanery of Central wasn't that harder to find - but it also allowed her to conceal when she wanted to use company funds beyond their intended use. Having made inroads with the other Chief Officers of ARC, Fielding plotted to turn the governorships of the Districts away from Central and to the ARC, before leaking the evidence of Modorski's corruption to force his resignation. While the campaign to turn the Districts on Central had its share of ups-and-downs, the ploy of ejecting Modorski has worked perfectly. Now, Fielding holds both the roles of ARC's CEO and CFO, making her the most powerful woman in the most powerful corporation in the world.\n\nWith Fielding now at the helm, and having used the balance sheet and financial weight of ARC as a massive lever in District politics, many wondered what Fielding would do next. Few expected that she would declare war on the Central government, drawing on ARC's vast engineering and manufacturing resources, and turning its private security forces into a full-fledged army capable of standing up to the Central military. But the biggest surprise is yet to come from Fielding, as she has plans beyond Central, beyond North America, and even beyond Earth itself.\n\n§OFor even though she has enough money to buy the world, the woman leading ARC finds more meaning in starting over with a new planet.§!"
 POLITICS_JENSEN_LANEMAN_DESC:0 "If there was one thing Colonel Laneman clung to more than his sidearm, it was his heritage. When the so-called Federal government let America devolve into chaos during the Great Mistake, his great-grandfather was among the soldiers to storm Capitol Hill.  When the new Central government had to withdraw to Denver after the East Coast sank into the sea, his grandfather would have a uniform and rifle as soon as he was of enlistment age. When Central launched the Unification War, Jensen and his father would both join the fight - his father a senior officer, himself a young frontline recruit. When the Central government simply let the country slip from their fingers rather than tighten their grip, spitting on his father's grave in the process, Jensen would resign in disgust.\n\nHaving initially become a wandering mercenary, joining any backwoods militia willing to stick it to the "spineless Centrists" who proved as equally weak as the "worthless Feds", Laneman quickly developed a reputation as not just a thorn in the side of many Central-aligned warlords, but also a nigh-legendary exterminator of urban gangs, and even other rural militias, with an especially notable brutality given towards self-proclaimed socialist factions. His skillset was too good for the ARC to simply ignore, so CEO Fielding would simply doctor a falsified record of him being one "Stephen Quaritch" - supposedly some sort of injoke among the spooks who swooped him from a foxhole in the Cascadian forest to a fortified office complex in what was once New Jersey.\n\nAlthough he accepted the chance to command a proper army, even if they were still "Private Military Contractors", Laneman knew it would be a matter of when, not if, he would strike Fielding down. She claimed to fight for America when Central wouldn't, but he knew their definitions of what America was could not have been more different. Her America was a hodge-podge gaggle of business suits and media brats, whose only motivation was getting any dollar by performing any transaction, no matter how degrading or outright treacherous it was.  Where all real control would be cast aside to let her supposed "invisible hand" guide the bloated corporate orchestra through some wheezing symphony. Now that he rules, His America would be one of discipline and order, where every man and woman would fight and bleed for their country, and all their children would be taught the true history of their nation. Where the squabbling Legislative and obstructive Judiciary branches would be cowed under a Supreme Executive.\n\n§RWhere the foreigners, all spies and saboteurs by nature, would either serve their place, or be cast out. Where "liberties" that degenerated the moral fabric would be crushed. Where America would not mean some pseudo-globalist Frankenstein of the North American continent, but THE United States of centuries past, where the 50 States would dominate their Canadian and Mexican lessers, and any other nation unfit to reap the bounty of the True American's Freedom.§!"
 POLITICS_GABRIEL_IVANOV_2_DESC:0 "There are many words that have been used to describe ARC's Chief Research Officer Gabriel Ivanov. "Ambitious". "Quirky". "Antisocial".  "Sociopathic". "Psychopathic". However, despite having almost every adjective that has existed in the English language (and a multitude of foreign language adjectives with no real equivalent in English) bieng used to describe Ivanov - by his admirers, his detractors, and even by himself - one word that cannot be said of him at any time is being complacent.\n\nBorn in 2150 in Siberia to a Russian father and Alaskan mother, Ivanov avoided the grueling poverty and hellish banditry that plagued the rest of the continent due to his personal family fortune, built by his father on the back of his mining company. Having briefly attended the Siberian Federal University, Ivanov moved to the University of Qinghua in 2167, before moving again two years later to Colorado College to achieve his Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Robotics. The next decade, between the rise and decline of Central's power in the 2160s and 2170s, would be an absolute blur, as Ivanov repeatedly made millions upon billions more than his father ever dreamed of by acquiring and merging various companies involved in experimental technologies, before ultimately being absorbed himself into the rising titan of the American Reclamation Corporation in the 2190s. Due to his affinity for pushing the scientific envelope - or at least being the most efficient at organizing hundreds of researchers to push the envelope for him - Ivanov was made the Chief Research Officer, and given control over the ARC's research facilities in the relatively sheltered District 8.\n\nNow that he has proven himself the better of Fielding - both as an entrepreneur and as a tactician - Ivanov is now set to accelerate ARC's focus on spaceflight to leave Earth, and the robotics and cybernetics needed to colonize different worlds. To do this, he is streamlining certain "superfluous" projects that Fielding was simply wasteful with. Projects like "providing infrastructure to the majority of citizens" or "ensuring every employee has the right to petition for workplace safety regulations". After all, with the Inflection Point less than half-a-decade away, what difference does it make if a few hundred thousand or so get a mangled limb or an infectious disease? No, best to build the escape ships now for himself and his like-minded peers, rather than waste time providing some false hope that the masses would not have to suffer when he leaves them behind.\n\n§OAfter all, one cannot get "Per Astera" without having to go through "Per Aspera" first.§!"
