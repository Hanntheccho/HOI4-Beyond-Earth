 OCH_heavy_research_facilities_desc:0 "District 8 is the site of extensive research by ARC R&D into engineering, AI design, and other areas that require extensive infrastructure. The reason for old Canada's hosting of these facilities is its remoteness from Central, but also that District 8 barely suffered from the 3rd Civil War, and therefore retained a sizable educated population. Currently spearheaded by regional ARC Vice President Gabriel Ivanov, the District hopes to achieve unparalleled advances in robotics technology."

 OCH_an_undead_dream_desc:0 "Ever since the formation of the North American Union following the 3rd Civil War, Canada has been considered, both by foreigners and much of its own population, as an integral part of the North American national identity. However, the old dream of an independent and true Canada has experienced a rebirth in the recent decades, largely through the efforts of one Thomas Woodman. Backed by both rich and poor discontented by ARC's extensive meddling in District affairs, many inhabitants of old Canada yearn for neutrality and their own independent state."
