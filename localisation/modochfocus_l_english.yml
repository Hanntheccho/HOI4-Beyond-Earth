 OCH_heavy_research_facilities_desc:0 "District 8 is the site of extensive research by ARC R&D into engineering, AI design, and other areas that require extensive infrastructure. The reason for old Canada's hosting of these facilities is its remoteness from Central, but also that District 8 barely suffered from the 3rd Civil War, and therefore retained a sizable educated population. Currently spearheaded by regional ARC Vice President Gabriel Ivanov, the District hopes to achieve unparalleled advances in robotics technology."

 OCH_an_undead_dream_desc:0 "Ever since the formation of the North American Union following the 3rd Civil War, Canada has been considered, both by foreigners and much of its own population, as an integral part of the North American national identity. However, the old dream of an independent and true Canada has experienced a rebirth in the recent decades, largely through the efforts of one Thomas Woodman. Backed by both rich and poor discontented by ARC's extensive meddling in District affairs, many inhabitants of old Canada yearn for neutrality and their own independent state."

 POLITICS_GABRIEL_IVANOV_DESC:0 "There are many words that have been used to describe ARC's Chief Research Officer Gabriel Ivanov. "Ambitious". "Quirky". "Antisocial". "Sociopathic". "Psychopathic". However, despite having almost every adjective that has existed in the English language (and a multitude of foreign language adjectives with no real equivalent in English) being used to describe Ivanov - by his admirers, his detractors, and even by himself - one word that cannot be said of him at any time is being complacent. Having effectively turned the entirety of District 8 into a glorified ARC research facility, the only real threat to Ivanov's authority is the rising sentiment of Canadian separatism that wants to stop "The Firaxite Man" from making their homeland his personal petri dish."
