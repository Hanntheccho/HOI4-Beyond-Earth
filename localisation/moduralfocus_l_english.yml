  ural_event.1.t:0 "Orange-Red Sky"
  ural_event.1.d:0 "Raskalov Yakovich - a relic from a bygone age. Sits in his office (run-down place, but still better than the rest of HQ) all week, probably fantasizes and runs over old memories. A glorified past is long gone, all that's left is this mess - Ivan and Zhluvov have already pulled the trigger, soon Yug Command will be a graveyard.\n\nRaskalov Yakovich leans against a balcony railing, observing the charred ground below. The late sky is dyed red, with a faint orange line above the setting sun. Far to the South lies the old nemesis - Central Asia. The wind is so fresh that it hurts Raskalov's dried skin, he grunts and leaves.\n\nRashkalov Yakovich lies on the mattress, empty vodka bottles scattered around. He cannot sleep, black spots rest under his eyes. Outside, the dark night is lit up by the forest fires, a brilliant display that digs into Rashkalov's mind."

  ural_event.2.t:0 "Meaning"
  ural_event.2.d:0 "Raskalov Yakovich shivers as he passes by the compound's guards. The heat and cold outside create a heavy fog, through which warlords are arriving. The snow melts under the weight of the white sun, Raskalov shields himself from it. The light burns.\n\nThe warlords of former Army Group Yug are a sorry bunch: old, disgraced, marshalling disgruntled veterans of a war which has faded into the abyss of the past. Raskalov's metal arm beckons the men into the compound. In the following hours, HQ and the rogues discuss strategy, but in the back of their minds rests a single thought, steadfast against the tide of history that threatens to wipe them off the face of a dying Earth - Raskalov knows what must be done, the warlords know what must be done, the soldiers know what must be done. Their job is not finished, the Urals are but a retreat, for in the South, their old nemesis, the cause of their disheveled state, the Central Asian Federation still breathes."

  URA_pillage_the_east:0 "Pillage The East"
  URA_pillage_the_east_desc:0 "To the East lie yet untouched villages. Sparsely populated by fools too slow to flee West, the people there sit upon significant iron reserves. By driving them off, we can restart mining operations abandoned during the Great Mistake, and rapidly produce quality bombard equipment."

  URA_pillage_the_west:0 "Pillage The West"
  URA_pillage_the_west_desc:0 "The Ural Mountains are home to yet undiscovered catches from before the Great Mistake. Now that we have restored a sense of unity among the warlords, we can combine our efforts to unearth these treasures."

  URA_a_body_for_every_gun:0 "A Body For Every Gun"
  URA_a_body_for_every_gun_desc:0 "Despite our successes in finding weaponry, Army Command still lacks men to throw at the enemy. We can conscript the few locals that remain, although they aren't good shots."

  URA_slap_scrap_together:0 "Slap Scrap Together"
  URA_slap_scrap_together_desc:0 "The Ural Mountains don't have much of an industry. Fortunately, there is plenty of loot to go around. By melting damaged vehicles and abandoned dwellings, we can create enough steel to supplement wood in construction."

  URA_bootstrap_the_industry:0 "Bootstrap The Industry"
  URA_bootstrap_the_industry_desc:0 "There is no private enterprise in the Urals - no sane business men dwell here. However, we are in dire need of a planning authority for our developing industry. By relegating power to local warlords, they can administer the construction of new factory complexes, and, hopefully, invest some of their own funding into the economy."

  URA_scavenge_for_guns:0 "Scavenge For Guns"
  URA_scavenge_for_guns_desc:0 "Our region is rich in abandoned military hardware. By sending dedicated scavenging parties out into the wilderness, we can locate enough weapons to arm a small army."

  URA_pool_the_loot:0 "Pool the loot"
  URA_pool_the_loot_desc:0 "In a most selfless and patriotic act, some soldiers have elected to pool their loot for melting and recycling. Trinkets, heirlooms, old guns, everything, everything must contribute to the upcoming war."

  URA_ural_arsenals:0 "Ural Arsenals"
  URA_ural_arsenals_desc:0 "There is an abandoned tractor factory near Zlatoust, from before the Great Mistake. It has been fought over by gangs for decades, but nobody has managed to hold it long enough to produce anything. By organizing a large raiding party, we can displace the local gangs and restart production."
  
  URA_reengineer_armor_designs:0 "Reengineer Armor Designs"
  URA_reengineer_armor_designs_desc:0 "When our troops entered the Zlatoust Tractor Plant, they discovered old Russian blueprints for main battle tanks. Although these designs are too complex to produce conventionally, we can put the factory into overdrive, use soldier labor, bring in iron from all over the Urals and dedicate sufficient energy to produce a small armored division. Naturally, this will wreck the factory permanently, but will be of great help in the upcoming conflict."

  URA_a_meeting_in_vuktyl:0 "A Meeting In Vuktyl"
  URA_a_meeting_in_vuktyl_desc:0 "Comrade Raskalov worked tirelessly to rejuvenate the Army Group. His efforts have proven fruitful, and HQ has seen fit to promote the old general to the highest rank in the Group - Verhovniy Marshal Evrasye. A meeting must be quickly organized to celebrate this special occasion!"

  URA_coup_d_grace:0 "Coup d'Grace"
  URA_coup_d_grace_desc:0 "Army Group Yug is staffed with aging officers, whose place would be more appropriate in a museum than on the battlefield. Proceeding with the invasion with these relics is suicide. A thorough sweep of all available military personnel must be conducted, and the old guard culled."

  URA_room_enough:0 "Room Enough"
  URA_room_enough_desc:0 "Although it is a pity that our leadership is old and tired, to replace them is simply unthinkable. The old guard has too much sway over our army and we cannot afford units deserting in the midst of the great offensive."

  URA_new_officers:0 "New Officers"
  URA_new_officers_desc:0 "Now that the old guard has been dealt with, we must turn our gaze to the young officers. Experienced in Ural warfare, these men and women have much to prove. Although they aren't as learned in the ways of modern warfare as their predecessors, their minds are more flexible for new possibilities."

  URA_old_contracts:0 "Old Contacts"
  URA_old_contracts_desc:0 "The old guard has many connections in Eurasia and beyond. We would be foolish not to exploit these contacts to smuggle in better weaponry and more resources."

  URA_shall_the_sky_turn_blue:0 "Shall The Sky Turn Blue?"
  URA_shall_the_sky_turn_blue_desc:0 "Redemption does not lie to the South, for there is nobody to redeem, no real wrong to right. But the soldiers know that the skies will clear of ash and clouds once the Army flag flies over old Omsk. Why else would they march to their deaths so eagerly?"

  URA_but_first_paint_the_ground_red:0 "But First, Paint The Ground Red"
  URA_but_first_paint_the_ground_red_desc:0 "The campaign to reclaim the Southern territories must be fast and coherent - we cannot afford another disaster. Although we are outnumbered and outgunned in all respects, the Federation is demobilized and unexpecting a Northern invasion. We must act quickly and rely on encirclements to deny the enemy a numerical advantage."

  URA_the_virtues_of_cohesion:0 "The Virtues of Cohesion"
  URA_the_virtues_of_cohesion_desc:0 "The upcoming war against the Central Asian Federation will demand everything from us. We lack the resources, the guns, the bodies… but, most importantly, our ranks have no cohesion. Soldiers answer directly to their warlords, who in turn provide foodstuffs and salvaged munition. Any war effort without a unified leadership is doomed.\n\nTo resolve this issue, Army Command will invite every warlord on the map, near and far. We will make concessions where necessary, reassure the former officer corps, and unite the old army. Although we do not have the time to fully mend the collapse of society in the Urals, getting the warlords to work together will be a significant accomplishment."

  URA_bribes:0 "Bribes"
  URA_bribes_desc:0 "The soldiers of the Urals care only about one thing: survival. Their loyalty to warlords is based on the latter's ability to provide rations, but because of the rapidly degrading climate in Siberia, fears of mass starvation abound. Army Command will resort to bribing warlords with stockpiled rations from before the war."

  URA_stabs:0 "Stabs"
  URA_stabs_desc:0 "Not all warlords can be reconciled by a well-placed bribe or promises of restoring former glory. Some have been driven mad by their pitiful existence, but continue to command hundreds of men. By utilizing former Spetsnaz operatives and drone strikes, HQ can assassinate unwanted individuals. The late warlords' armies will then be absorbed into Army Command for future usage."

  URA_marching:0 "Marching"
  URA_marching_desc:0 "Army Group Yug was never disciplined to begin with - harassed by Kazakh raiders and suffering from low supply, weak men chose to flee rather than stand their ground. We cannot suffer another mass rout - every soldier is to be drilled and disciplined until they are ready to die for the cause."
