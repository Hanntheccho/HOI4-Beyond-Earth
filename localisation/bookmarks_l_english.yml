Led by technocratic environmentalists, influential activists, and ultra-modern politicians, the goals of INTEGR were clear: build a better future by acknowledging our past mistakes.

 SCO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Scotland may not look like a powerhouse, but it leads an alliance with greater potential. The North Sea Alliance meant to make those low countries fight the rising tide together before the end of the Dark Days, but is now aiming to dominate the seas. The power struggle between England and Scotland for leadership is dynamiting the Alliance from within. As England teeters on the verge of civil war, European powers are mobilizing to support their respective sides in the unavoidable conflict. The destiny of the Alliance lies on the need of these countries to find common values, through war or through peace."
