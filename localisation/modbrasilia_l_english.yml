  BRA_one_last_shot:0 "One Last Shot"
  BRA_one_last_shot_desc:0 "Hear, hear, citizens of Brazil! The future of your great nation lays in YOUR hands. This year will decide our fate. Shall we come together as a nation? Put aside our petty differences? Unite against hate and injustice? Shall we fight in unity against the corrupt forces of the Andean Compact?\n\nWill you, citizen, allow your entire family to be massacred by the Andeans? Would you watch them nerve staple your children and trample on your country’s flag? Go! Pick up a weapon, a spade, a hammer! Go to the front, to the factories, do not fear. When we are one - we are indestructible."
  BRA_its_all_crashing_down:0 "It's All Crashing Down"
  BRA_its_all_crashing_down_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the 2198 coup, Rejinaldo de Alencar and his clique of supporters have plotted and tried everything in and beyond their power to save the regime. However, rampant deterioration of the Amazon rainforests, the collapse of order in urban centers, and the failure of the Space Campaign have taken their toll. The Brazilian people yearn for peace and accept slow rebuilding. But the regime still has an ace up its sleeve…"
  BRA_lack_of_cohesion:0 "Lack of Cohesion"
  BRA_lack_of_cohesion_desc:0 "The Brazilian army is composed primarily from disgruntled raiders, conscripts, and other unprofessional individuals. Experience ranges wildly from soldier to soldier, but the army has thus far failed to act as a single body in training exercises."
  BRA_lack_of_cohesion1:0 "Lack of Cohesion"
  BRA_lack_of_cohesion1_desc:0 "The Brazilian army is composed primarily from disgruntled raiders, conscripts, and other unprofessional individuals. Experience ranges wildly from soldier to soldier, but the army has thus far failed to act as a single body in training exercises."
  
 #Focuses
  BRA_limited_purge:0 "Limited Purge"
  BRA_limited_purge_desc:0 "To sabotage one's country on the eve of war is a crime punishable by death. Unfortunately, even our nation is filled with deserters, traitors, and cowards. General Velho has already outlined a list of suspects and organized hunting teams. Let none stand in the way of glorious victory!"
  BRA_finish_military_buildup:0 "Finish Military Buildup"
  BRA_finish_military_buildup_desc:0 "General Velho's staff has done a good job militarizing the population. The last two years saw Brazil's military industry grow from a few shacks producing Dark Age rifles to one of the continent's largest."
  BRA_draft_additional_production_goals:0 "Draft Additional Production Goals"
  BRA_draft_additional_production_goals_desc:0 "What we have is only barely enough. More guns, more artillery, more tanks are needed if we are to break the Compact's back! People work harder when they have a concrete goal in mind, so we should create higher and higher standards for our factories."
  BRA_big_expectations:0 "Big Expectations"
  BRA_big_expectations_desc:0 "There can be no compromise in the pursuit of victory. At the climax of our war with the Andean Compact, our armies must lack nothing! We must become the largest and strongest military on Earth, and do so in less than a year!"
  BRA_cuiaba_arms_drive:0 ""Cuiaba Arms Drive"
  BRA_cuiaba_arms_drive_desc:0 "The city of Cuiaba in the Mato Grosso region is one of the regime's strongholds. Serving as General Velho's homeland and the place where he first raised his banner during the 2180's series of coups, the city's inhabitants are exceptionally loyal to the cause. We should rely on their goodwill and patriotism to collect local guns and ammunition."
  BRA_deal_with_arc:0 "Deal With ARC"
  BRA_deal_with_arc_desc:0 "Over the Atlantic lies the shattered nation of North America. One of its biggest corporations and warlords is the American Reclamation Corporation, with whom we have had the pleasure of doing business during the administration's first few weeks. We can buy some of their modern support and artillery equipment with money taken from imprisoned dissidents."
  BRA_introduce_automation:0 "Introduce Automation"
  BRA_introduce_automation_desc:0 "As much as we may hate to admit it, most of Brazil's factories are hopelessly out of date. While the nations of Europe and Africa use cutting edge-automated equipment and robots, our workers are stuck with ancient power tools and manual labor. We must import new technologies to close the production gap with other powers."
  BRA_aim_for_the_industrial_dream:0 "Aim for the Industrial Dream"
  BRA_aim_for_the_industrial_dream_desc:0 "Technically speaking, the Brazilian nation is decently industrialized. However, we could be so much more. Let us focus on heavy industry and build up a strong economy before fighting the Andean Pact."
  BRA_brasilia_renovations:0 "Brasilia Renovations"
  BRA_brasilia_renovations_desc:0 "The national capital of Brasilia is in a strong position. Being at the center of the country and far from the flooded areas on the coasts and rainforests, Brasilia is home to most of the country's industry. We should invest in its railway system and renovate the highways."
  BRA_northern_industrial_expansion:0 "Northern Industrial Expansion"
  BRA_northern_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "We should focus on rebuilding the Northern states after their suffering at the hands of anarchy and floods."
  BRA_coastal_industrial_expansion:0 "Coastal Industrial Expansion"
  BRA_coastal_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "A century later, and the Brazilian coastline is still recovering from the effects of the Great Mistake. We must intensify land utilization and reclaim some salvageable swamps."
  BRA_amazonian_highways:0 "Amazonian Highways"
  BRA_amazonian_highways_desc:0 "The Amazon rainforests have lost much in the wake of the Great Mistake. It is our duty to repair the damage done to nature and return civilization to the West."
  BRA_revive_rainforest_industries:0 "Revive Rainforest Industries"
  BRA_revive_rainforest_industries_desc:0 "The Amazon Rainforest used to be home to many woodcutting camps and rubber plantations prior to the Great Mistake and the decades of turmoil that followed. We should reopen abandoned factories and encourage worker migration to the West."
  BRA_continental_powerhouse:0 "Continental Powerhouse"
  BRA_continental_powerhouse_desc:0 "Although our current efforts haven't put us on par with global powers like Franco-Iberia and China, they are a start. Our industry has expanded dramatically in the last year and this is cause for a great celebration!"
  BRA_extended_purge:0 "Extended Purge"
  BRA_extended_purge_desc:0 "Although we have been hoping that a small purge of suspicious army commanders and career politicians would be sufficient to cement our regime's power, it appears more work is needed. There is a collection of minor conspiracies consisting of plots to restore the old cabinet, as well as plans by petty officers to assume additional power. By using drone strikes to our advantage, we can isolate and exterminate dissident leadership, effectively cutting off the head of the snake."
  BRA_show_them_the_loot:0 "Show Them the Loot"
  BRA_show_them_the_loot_desc:0 "Many officers have been complaining of poor pay. Luckily, our recent industrialization efforts and purges have turned up quite a bit of expendable cash. While certain elements of the government argue for using this money to pay off debts or rebuild villages, the army comes first. We can offer bribes to warlords and fresh conscripts to raise their morale."
  BRA_offer_them_the_glory:0 "Offer Them the Glory"
  BRA_offer_them_the_glory_desc:0 "We have nothing to spare for our underpaid armies. However, we can still offer them large shares of the loot we will capture in the Compact’s territories."
  BRA_tier_two_training:0 "Tier II Training"
  BRA_tier_two_training_desc:0 "Our army currently uses the Tier I Training system, putting them on par with militias rather than professional soldiers. This is largely due in part to the extended conscription system, which has resulted in a large influx of inexperienced and disgruntled soldiers. We should put our officers on training duty to at least bring some standardization to the armed forces"
  BRA_militarize_the_universities:0 "Militarize the Universities"
  BRA_militarize_the_universities_desc:0 "Brazil is home to some of the wisest scholars in the Americas. However, most of those academics are busy studying technical skills. While admirable, the short-term demands that we refocus all education efforts on military innovations immediately."
  BRA_overhaul_naval_plans:0 "Overhaul Naval Plans"
  BRA_overhaul_naval_plans_desc:0 "Our navy is not in the best shape. Still, it is large enough to project power across continental waters and may survive a battle with the Andean Compact. Producing additional ships will take too long, so we should focus on training our sailors."
  BRA_reopen_the_ports:0 "Reopen the Ports"
  BRA_reopen_the_ports_desc:0 "The Brazilian fleet is rather outdated. Fortunately, there are still some closed drydocks in the Northern and Eastern regions of our country. By injecting some cash into the naval industry, we can reopen them for military business."
  BRA_legacy_of_bastos:0 "Legacy of Bastos"
  BRA_legacy_of_bastos_desc:0 "Talita Bastos was a military scientist famous for inventing the Bastos Mk2 Combat Rifle, which was widely used by South American and African forces for over 3 decades. Though long dead, we can work with the blueprints that Professor Bastos left to design a rifle worthy for the 23rd century."
  BRA_modern_engineering:0 "Modern Engineering"
  BRA_modern_engineering_desc:0 "Quality trumps quantity, or so they say. We should hire foreign designers and engineers to upgrade our factory plants with modern automated techniques and robot claws to alleviate some of the pressure placed on our hardworking workers."
  BRA_walker_innovations:0 "Walker Innovations"
  BRA_walker_innovations_desc:0 "Walkers, supported by mountain infantry and artillery barrages, are the future. Capable of traversing difficult terrain such as mountains and jungles, the walker is a versatile and deadly tank"
  BRA_the_air_war:0 "The Air War"
  BRA_the_air_war_desc:0 "Victory lies in the air war, and the country that dominates orbit will win all future wars. We should train our pilots and invest in automated computer tracking systems to beat the Andean Compact in the sky."
