  BRA_one_last_shot_desc:0 "Hear, hear, citizens of Brazil! The future of your great nation lays in YOUR hands. This year will decide our fate. Shall we come together as a nation? Put aside our petty differences? Unite against hate and injustice? Shall we fight in unity against the corrupt forces of the Andean Compact?\n\nWill you, citizen, allow your entire family to be massacred by the Andeans? Would you watch them nerve staple your children and trample on your country's flag? Go! Pick up a weapon, a spade, a hammer! Go to the front, to the factories, do not fear. When we are one - we are indestructible."
  BRA_its_all_crashing_down:0 "It's All Crashing Down"
  BRA_its_all_crashing_down_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the 2198 coup, Manuel Branco Velho and his clique of supporters have plotted and tried everything in and beyond their power to save the regime. However, rampant deterioration of the Amazon rainforests, the collapse of order in urban centers, and the failure of the Space Campaign have taken their toll. The Brazilian people yearn for peace and accept slow rebuilding. But the regime still has an ace up its sleeve..."
  BRA_lack_of_cohesion:0 "Lack of Cohesion"
  BRA_lack_of_cohesion_desc:0 "The Brazilian army suffers from rampant unprofessionalism, with most of our rank-and-file consisting of conscripts and former criminals pressed into service. While our officer corps remain some of the best on the continent, they can only do so much when the soldiers under their command are completely lacking in discipline. If Brazil is to survive the coming war with the Compact, then these grunts must be hammered into shape."

  GRP_low_legitimacy:0 "Low Legitimacy"
  GRP_low_legitimacy_desc:0 "Despite our best intentions, a large portion of the Brazilian population is too preoccupied with not dying to see the Provisional Government as a viable side. The past smears the present, and Watambe's old failures, no matter how unfair and misunderstood, are still fresh in the minds of all Brazilians."
 #Lamentadores
  LAM_behavioral_stability_guerrila_oriented:0 "Behavioral Stability: Guerrila Oriented"
  LAM_behavioral_stability_guerrila_oriented_desc:0 "Our country is controlled and led by Amazonian partisan groups. Decades of isolation and survivalism have molded the Amazonians into gritty guerillas. While the locals are quite capable of waging war and making use of every tactical advantage, the people we liberate are suspicious of our methods. Partisans take residence in peoples' homes, collect everything necessary for the war effort, and (as rumour has it) have even staged purges in periphery territories."

  BRA_limited_purge:0 "Limited Purge"
  BRA_limited_purge_desc:0 "To sabotage one's country on the eve of war is a crime punishable by death. Unfortunately, even our nation is filled with deserters, traitors, and cowards. General Velho has already outlined a list of suspects and organized hunting teams. Let none stand in the way of glorious victory!"
  BRA_finish_military_buildup:0 "Finish Military Buildup"
  BRA_finish_military_buildup_desc:0 "General Velho's staff has done a good job militarizing the population. The last two years saw Brazil's military industry grow from a few shacks producing Dark Age rifles to one of the continent's largest."
  BRA_draft_additional_production_goals:0 "Draft Additional Production Goals"
  BRA_draft_additional_production_goals_desc:0 "What we have is only barely enough. More guns, more artillery, more tanks are needed if we are to break the Compact's back! People work harder when they have a concrete goal in mind, so we should create higher and higher standards for our factories."
  BRA_big_expectations:0 "Big Expectations"
  BRA_big_expectations_desc:0 "There can be no compromise in the pursuit of victory. At the climax of our war with the Andean Compact, our armies must lack nothing! We must become the largest and strongest military on Earth, and do so in less than a year!"
  BRA_cuiaba_arms_drive:0 ""Cuiaba Arms Drive"
  BRA_cuiaba_arms_drive_desc:0 "The city of Cuiaba in the Mato Grosso region is one of the regime's strongholds. Serving as General Velho's homeland and the place where he first raised his banner during the 2180's series of coups, the city's inhabitants are exceptionally loyal to the cause. We should rely on their goodwill and patriotism to collect local guns and ammunition."
  BRA_deal_with_arc:0 "Deal With ARC"
  BRA_deal_with_arc_desc:0 "Over the Atlantic lies the shattered nation of North America. One of its biggest corporations and warlords is the American Reclamation Corporation, with whom we have had the pleasure of doing business during the administration's first few weeks. We can buy some of their modern support and artillery equipment with money taken from imprisoned dissidents."
  BRA_introduce_automation:0 "Introduce Automation"
  BRA_introduce_automation_desc:0 "As much as we may hate to admit it, most of Brazil's factories are hopelessly out of date. While the nations of Europe and Africa use cutting edge-automated equipment and robots, our workers are stuck with ancient power tools and manual labor. We must import new technologies to close the production gap with other powers."
  BRA_aim_for_the_industrial_dream:0 "Aim for the Industrial Dream"
  BRA_aim_for_the_industrial_dream_desc:0 "Technically speaking, the Brazilian nation is decently industrialized. However, we could be so much more. Let us focus on heavy industry and build up a strong economy before fighting the Andean Pact."
  BRA_brasilia_renovations:0 "Brasilia Renovations"
  BRA_brasilia_renovations_desc:0 "The national capital of Brasilia is in a strong position. Being at the center of the country and far from the flooded areas on the coasts and rainforests, Brasilia is home to most of the country's industry. We should invest in its railway system and renovate the highways."

  BRA_continental_powerhouse:0 "Continental Powerhouse"
  BRA_continental_powerhouse_desc:0 "Although our current efforts haven't put us on par with global powers like Franco-Iberia and China, they are a start. Our industry has expanded dramatically in the last year and this is cause for a great celebration!"
  BRA_extended_purge:0 "Extended Purge"
  BRA_extended_purge_desc:0 "Although we have been hoping that a small purge of suspicious army commanders and career politicians would be sufficient to cement our regime's power, it appears more work is needed. There is a collection of minor conspiracies consisting of plots to restore the old cabinet, as well as plans by petty officers to assume additional power. By using drone strikes to our advantage, we can isolate and exterminate dissident leadership, effectively cutting off the head of the snake."
  BRA_show_them_the_loot:0 "Show Them the Loot"
  BRA_show_them_the_loot_desc:0 "Many officers have been complaining of poor pay. Luckily, our recent industrialization efforts and purges have turned up quite a bit of expendable cash. While certain elements of the government argue for using this money to pay off debts or rebuild villages, the army comes first. We can offer bribes to warlords and fresh conscripts to raise their morale."
  BRA_offer_them_the_glory:0 "Offer Them the Glory"
  BRA_offer_them_the_glory_desc:0 "We have nothing to spare for our underpaid armies. However, we can still offer them large shares of the loot we will capture in the Compact's territories."
  BRA_tier_two_training:0 "Tier II Training"
  BRA_tier_two_training_desc:0 "Our army currently uses the Tier I Training system, putting them on par with militias rather than professional soldiers. This is largely due in part to the extended conscription system, which has resulted in a large influx of inexperienced and disgruntled soldiers. We should put our officers on training duty to at least bring some standardization to the armed forces"
  BRA_militarize_the_universities:0 "Militarize the Universities"
  BRA_militarize_the_universities_desc:0 "Brazil is home to some of the wisest scholars in the Americas. However, most of those academics are busy studying technical skills. While admirable, the short-term demands that we refocus all education efforts on military innovations immediately."
  BRA_overhaul_naval_plans:0 "Overhaul Naval Plans"
  BRA_overhaul_naval_plans_desc:0 "Our navy is not in the best shape. Still, it is large enough to project power across continental waters and may survive a battle with the Andean Compact. Producing additional ships will take too long, so we should focus on training our sailors."
  BRA_reopen_the_ports:0 "Reopen the Ports"
  BRA_reopen_the_ports_desc:0 "The Brazilian fleet is rather outdated. Fortunately, there are still some closed drydocks in the Northern and Eastern regions of our country. By injecting some cash into the naval industry, we can reopen them for military business."
  BRA_legacy_of_bastos:0 "Legacy of Bastos"
  BRA_legacy_of_bastos_desc:0 "Talita Bastos was a military scientist famous for inventing the Bastos Mk2 Combat Rifle, which was widely used by South American and African forces for over 3 decades. Though long dead, we can work with the blueprints that Professor Bastos left to design a rifle worthy for the 23rd century."
  BRA_modern_engineering:0 "Modern Engineering"

  brazil.1.t:0 "And Now, A Word From The President of Brasilia…"
  brazil.1.d:0 "All across Brasilia, feeds automatically tuned in to livestream from the capital. Everything from ancient televisions to urban mesh networks abruptly shifted into a brief blur of static, clearing into a shot of President Manuel Branco Velho before a podium, flanked by rows of generals on either side. His face, as always, was stern. Weathered, with lines that spoke of a long career as a soldier rather than a politician. President Velho himself spoke with a similar, self-evident bluntness.\n\n"People of Brasilia. I come before you today, a proud man. Proud not of my own accomplishments, but of yours! Yes, yours! In these past two years we have endured much as a nation. All of us have sacrificed something for the good of our people, for our families, our neighbors, our fatherland. Yet we no longer have to sacrifice our pride as a nation! No longer must we sacrifice our liberties for the sake of foreign greed! No longer must we sacrifice our lives for the sake of scheming politicians! What we have sacrificed, brothers and sisters, we have sacrificed in the name of Brazil and Brazil alone! Yes! For this, I am proud of you!"\n\n"I swear to you that soon, yes, soon all of our sacrifices shall bear fruit! No longer shall our children fear of foreign aggression! No longer must we fear starvation as our neighbors grow fat from their plunder! No longer, I tell you! No longer shall Brasilia suffer from fear and doubt, for we are building a brighter future together, my brothers and sisters! Our forces are strong, yes, yet our resolve is even stronger! Be proud, people of Brasilia, for it is you who will lead us to victory!""
  brazil.1.a:0 "Já não! Avante para a vitória!"
  brazil.2.t:0 "The State of the Armed Forces"
  brazil.2.d:0 "As one would expect, the Brazilian Armed Forces are at the heart of General Velho's regime. With most political functions "temporarily" suspended by the state of emergency, power is largely concentrated in the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces in what is effectively a military junta headed by General Velho's nationalist clique. Though the junta still enjoys a degree of popular support, owing to widespread anti-Andean sentiment, the fact remains that Brazil is a state governed by the strength of its army.\n\nAt present, Brazil currently maintains the largest military in the western hemisphere. Yet while quantity is not an issue, quality most certainly is. The vast majority of Brazillian soldiers are conscripts, undertrained and underequipped. In many regiments, the closest thing to trained soldiers are thugs from the favelas and bandits from the country. While the Compact's armed forces are small compared to Brazil's, they are considerably more professionalized and have access to objectively superior weapons.\n\nYet General Velho remains confident in the capabilities of the Brazilian military. "Wars are not won by fancy toys or lazy politicians," the general declared in his address to the Joint Staff, "but by superior tactics and strategic brilliance. Where the Compact was founded by refugees safe in their mountain villas, our republic was saved by the bravery of our armed forces. Unlike the Andes, Brazil is no stranger to war. They will learn this for themselves soon enough!""
  brazil.2.a:0 "An army of donkeys, led by lions..."
  brazil.3.t:0 "The State of the Economy"
  brazil.3.d:0 "Hit particularly hard by the Great Mistake, the economy of Brazil quite literally vanished overnight. Brazil's largest industrial centers, vast tracts of arable land, and the cornucopia of the Amazon were all utterly destroyed. From the military junta's attempt at instituting a command economy to President Watanabe's disastrous privatization campaigns, every endeavor to restore Brazil's industrial might has seemingly been doomed to fail.\n\nToday, only the cities of Brasília, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and Curitiba remain viable industrial centers. The rest of the country has largely reverted to agrarianism out of necessity, leaving little room for further economic growth or developments without proper capital. What few urban centers remain could more accurately be described as city-sized favelas, crowded by the impoverished descendents of coastal refugees, interrupted by islands of the neighborhood-compounds of the rich and powerful.\n\nMobilizing such a haggard economy is a difficult task, yet General Velho has made surprising progress over the past two years. Financed by assets seized from pro-Watanabe oligarchs in the aftermath of the '98 coup, the military-industrial complex has managed to expand significantly in preparation for war against the Compact. While the economy has seen steady growth as a result, the fact remains that the Joint Staff is paying for such expansion with "borrowed" capital. Many international observers, largely critics of the Velho regime, believe this unprecedented period of unsustainable growth may yield disastrous consequences for the Brazilian economy.\n\nBy contrast, the mood in Brasilia itself is very optimistic. Just as General Velho himself is confident in a Brazilian victory against the Andes, so too is he confident that the territory to be gained as a result will more than make up for the costs of mobilization, making no secrets of his designs on the lithium mines of the Andes. While some may argue that this a double-edged sword, where failure to seize the wealth of the Andes will result in a potential financial crisis, General Velho certainly is not entertaining the idea of failure."
  brazil.3.a:0 "General Velho's gamble will pay off. It has to."
  brazil.4.t:0 "The State of Brazil"
  brazil.4.d:0 "A cursory glance through the newsfeeds of Brazil show a nation ready, willing, and able to march against the Andean menace. A smiling field hand in the verdant fields of a Bahian plantation states with pride how her beloved filho just made sergeant in the marine corps. Military engineers in Rio Branco complete construction of an anti-drone installation, surrounded by an applauding crowd of grateful civilians. A spontaneous rally in support of General Velho's Andean crusade erupts in Cuiaba, gathering around a smiling holograph of the man himself, waving flags and proudly saluting the savior of Brazil.\n\nYet a closer glance at the actual streets of Brazil tells a very different tale. One of an exhausted, weary nation. The patriotic fervor that accompanied Velho's march on Brasilia has long since dissipated, replaced by a dejected ennui. Most Brazilians fear the depredations of gangsters from the favelas or bandits from the hills, not soldiers from the Andes. More than anything however, the common folk fear being unable to provide for their families, trapped as they are in a perpetual cycle of poverty and violence.\n\nGeneral Velho is not a man blinded by his own propaganda. Indeed, he is wholly aware of the grim reality many Brazilians face. He endured them himself, after all, in the slums of Cuiaba. Yet from his lofty position in Brasilia, he sees that Brazil itself remains trapped in the very same cycle of hardship, unable to escape. Not without help.\n\nNot without one last victory for Brazil."

  brazil.8.d:0 "For the people of Brazil, the twenty-second century  exemplified the same cycle of highs and lows that defined Brazilian history, swinging like a pendulum between republican democracies and authoritarian strongmen, times of plenty and times of chaos. When the trials of the Great Mistake came, there was panic and confusion, yet the pendulum kept swinging all the same.\n\nLike the rest of the globe, Brazil lost much to the rising tide. The cities of Rio de Janiero, Salvador da Bahia, and Fortaleza were swept away in the Deluge, displacing millions of Brazilian citizens. The Amazon Rainforest, or what little of it remained as the sea flooded the basin, suffered a near total ecological collapse thanks to devastating wildfires and rampant deforestation. The Republic of Brazil quickly veered towards collapse as banditry, neo-coronelism, and insurrectionists tore the nation apart at the seams.\n\nAs the civilian government faltered, the Brazilian Armed Forces seized control of the republic in a relatively bloodless coup and established a military junta. Centered in the city of Brasilia, the military quickly mobilized what few resources remained and embarked on a long campaign against the warlords and rogue states that had risen up during the Great Mistake. After a decade of non-stop civil war, the military junta managed to reunify the nation under its repressive, yet stabilizing rule."
  brazil.8.a:0 "Off to a rocky start..."
  brazil.9.t:0 "Brazil - Part Two"
  brazil.9.d:0 "With Brazil once again made whole, the Brasilia Junta began the slow transition from military dictatorship to unitary republic. Industries were rebuilt, refugees were resettled, and preparations were made to slowly reintroduce democracy to the Brazilian people… albeit under the close supervision of the military. The Brasilia Junta transformed into the Seventh Brazilian Republic.\n\nFor a short while, things were looking bright for Brasilia… yet still the pendulum swung.\n\nBrasilia's postwar economic recovery bottlenecked. While core industries were shakily approaching pre-Mistake levels, the state's dirigisme left them woefully outdated. Urban development came to a slow halt, and soon the infamous favelas of Brasilia's past made their unwelcome return throughout the country. Then came the disastrous "Campanha Espacial.""
  brazil.9.a:0 "Hoo boy."
  brazil.10.t:0 "Brazil - Part Three"
  brazil.10.d:0 "In 2196, President Frederico Campos Watanabe announced the "Campanha Espacial", the "Space Campaign". Working with investors from the Andean Compact, Brasilia would transform the Amazon Sea region into South America's first major spaceport, an undertaking President Watanabe claimed would both reinvigorate and modernize the nation's economy. Instead, the Space Campaign quickly became a political disaster for the Watanabe administration, one that would lead to the end of the Seventh Republic.\n\nMegastructure projects were constantly stalled by natural disasters, logistical snafus, labor strikes, and investment pullouts that left Brasilia footing the bill for much of the endeavor. As the Space Campaign dragged on, the situation in Brasilia continued to worsen. Many voices had begun to accuse President Watanabe of putting the interests of the Andean elite above that of his own people, the loudest among them coming from the Brasilian Armed Forces. Fiercely nationalistic, the Brasilian general staff quickly began to view the Watanabe administration as a threat to national security. Tensions between the civilian government and the armed forces continued to simmer until 2198, when rumors of an encroaching budget cut rippled through the army's ranks. The pot boiled over. The pendulum completed its swing.\n\nGeneral Manuel Branco Velho and his clique of nationalist officers marched on the city of Brasilia, deposing President Watanabe and reestablishing military rule. Claiming that Brasilia was under the imminent threat of an Andean invasion, General Velho announced a state of emergency until Brasilia was truly secure from threats both internal and external.\n\nFor the past two years, General Velho and the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces have maintained the state of emergency, overseeing the gradual mobilization of the sluggish Brasilian economy. Foreign industries have been nationalized under military control. Conscription has been ramped up with the goal of bringing as many Brasilians out of the favelas and into the barracks as possible. For the past two years, Brasilia has held her breath in anticipation for the final conflict. It has come time to decide whether General Velho shall lead her to greatness, or if the pendulum shall swing back sooner than expected..."

It does not matter that the last century was wasted in civil wars and economic turmoil, it is simply irrelevant that the once glorious nation of Brazil is now hanging by a thread. There is no way to change the past, but there is still hope for the present.\n\nThe great leader Manuel Velho has been preparing the country for war ever since his ascension to office in March of 2198 following the collapse of the old Mendes cabinet. As Brazil collapses around him, General Velho predicts that the only way to salvage the situation is by winning a war against the Andean Compact to the West. Rich with lithium and ever a thorn in Brazil's reconstruction efforts, the Compact must be stopped before it takes over the rest of the continent."
