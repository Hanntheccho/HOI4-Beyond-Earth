  CHI_china_long_united:0 "China Long United"
  CHI_china_long_united_desc:0 "China has been united under single party leadership since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949. While many reforms may have happened since then, in many ways the Chinese government is a relic of the old world before the Great Mistake, poorly adapted to face the coming crisis."
  CHI_a_dying_superpower:0 "A Dying Superpower"
  CHI_a_dying_superpower_desc:0 "After the Great Mistake, China emerged as the sole world leader replacing the US. However, decades of floods and other environmental disasters have left China in a position barely able to maintain control over its own country, let alone its ever shrinking sphere of influence."
  CHI_succession_crisis:0 "Succession Crisis"
  CHI_succession_crisis_desc:0 "The death of Party Chairwoman Fu Zhong last year under suspicious circumstances has inflamed the already delicate political situation. National leadership is currently being contested between several factions of the People's Party, further degrading its already low legitimacy, while political groups external to the party continue to grow in power and the country becomes increasingly decentralised."
  CHI_industrial_powerhouse:0 "Industrial Powerhouse"
  CHI_industrial_powerhouse_desc:0 "While China faces many challenges there is no denying it remains the undisputed world leader in many industrial sectors, with the size of its well educated population unmatched by any other nation."
  CHI_strategic_cooperation_organization_member:0 "Strategic Cooperation Organisation Member"
  CHI_strategic_cooperation_organization_member_desc:0 "The Strategic Cooperation Organisation was formed in the golden age of Chinese international power, primarily as a means for it to more easily trade and influence its sphere. However, decades of flooding has left Chinese influence in the organisation far weaker, leading it to take a far more balanced role as an economic and military alliance. But with political turmoil in many of its member states it seems like the SCO may soon be relegated to the history books."
  
 #Leaders
  POLITICS_DISPUTED_LEADERSHIP_DESC:0 "Last year, China's previous de jure Chinese leader and figurehead of the federal clique Fu Zhong would officially die of a stroke at the relatively young age of 62, with the subject of her death being a focus of many conspiracies, due to an ongoing succession crisis between her and Liang Xiaowen of the unitary clique. With Sun Zongying, his successor, taking his place as leader of the federal clique, this political crisis shows no sign of ending."
  POLITICS_LIANG_XIAOWEN_DESC:0 "Liang Xiaowen is the leader of the unitary clique and incumbent Party Secretary and Mayor of Beijing, serving in government for over four decades. He is currently the self declared provisional chairman of the Central Committee.\n\nLiang has seen much change in his long governmental service, coming from a long line of politicians he would follow his parents' example joining the CPC at the age of 21 after an education in political science.\n\nWhile initially part of the Beijing Clique with his parents he would switch sides to support the 2159 coup, going as far to purge his own father from the party to prove his loyalty. This "commitment" would be noticed by the re-established civilian government with Liang becoming one of the key founding members of Chinese People's Party under Xue Zemin, becoming Vice Premier of the State Council and member of the Politburo.\n\nAfter a spat with Zemin he would be demoted to a minor position in Inner Mongolia, conveniently avoiding the worst of the corruption scandals that would follow. He would in fact use his apparent opposition to Zemin during the transition of power to make himself out as the great anti-corruption reformer needed to fix the aging bureaucracy. Despite the fame that this populism would earn him, his political career had suffered major setbacks due to his partial purge, with many former allies no longer willing to associate with him.\n\nFu Zhong's ascendancy to power in 2192 and his radical push for democratic federalism would however give Liang the opposition he needed to rally much of the CPP's old guard behind him, forming a reactionary unitary clique to oppose recent reforms. Increasing national instability, mass strikes and the Chengdu uprising only seemed to give credence to his claims.\n\nIn 2198 Liang would make his move, using a dispute over water turned violent between the Tibetan and Qinghai regional governments as justification, declaring himself provisional chairman of the Central Committee in Beijing while Fu Zhong was on a political tour in Fujian causing the largest political crisis since the dissolution of the CPC, one that continues to this day."
  POLITICS_SUN_ZONGYING_DESC:0 "Sun Zongying is a relatively new entry to the political scene. As a famous actress many have derided her ascension to high office during Fu Zhong’s government as nothing but a poor popularity stunt. Her appointment as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2194 in particular caused outrage among the party’s ranks due to the clash with the technocratic nature of the state. However this discontent would dissipate both since Sun would perform her role adequately, even under this increased scrutiny, and far more significant crises would arise.\n\nSun would again take the spotlight as the face of the federalists campaigns for regional autonomy. Again she would be denounced by opposing party rankers as nothing more than a paid actor, a desperate attempt to make Fu Zhong’s policy that they claimed would tear apart the People’s Republic more palatable by having a popular celebrity support them, a strategy that worked surprisingly well as evidenced by opinion polls during this period. Even in debates Sun would hold her own against sceptics and politicians alike. The question of her competency or political literacy would soon become a joke in itself, with a clip of her demolishing a pro-unitary journalist during an interview going viral.\n\nIn the power vacuum of Fu Zhong’s death Sun would be an obvious choice for succession of the movement. She was arguably more well known than her predecessor and with the unitary clique making their move there was little time for infighting on the issue. However there is still concern even among her political supporters of both her commitment to the movement and the risk of a cult of personality arising around her."
  POLITICS_LIU_ZHIHAO_DESC:0 "Liu Zhihao is a prominent purist Dongbei politician, heading the National Revitalisation Movement within the Chinese People’s Party. Born in Harbin to a family of doctors he would similarly pursue a career in medicine before later transitioning to politics due to his disdain for Xue administration. Proving himself a capable administrator he rose through the ranks of the Chinese People’s Party and has notably served various senior roles within the Dongbei administration, despite being openly opposed to the rule of Fu Zhong and his reforms.\n\nAfter the assasination of Zhong, Zhihao would utilise the chaos created as well as a long perceived decline of the PRC to successfully push for his unique style of reactionism. A promised return to the glory of the old People’s Republic, he would capitalise on nostalgia that remained strong among the older generations and Chinese nationalists, who felt that China had lost its way. He provides a much desired third way in the succession crisis between the Unitaries and Federals (although technically also being unitary), criticising both as failing to address the crisis the nation finds itself in."
  POLITICS_DAOMING_SOCHUA_DESC:0 "Daoming Sochua was born to a Chinese mother and Cambodian father, raised in the traditions of both cultures. She tested at genius levels at a very young age and progressed rapidly through the state-sponsored school systems for gifted children. She quickly surpassed her parents – who were both university professors in the sciences — and her bright siblings in her studies. Entering university in her early teens, she proved focused and motivated to dominate her older peers.\n\nBy the age of thirty, she held four PhDs in electrical engineering, nano-electronics, nuclear physics, and bubble fusion. Pioneering ground-breaking methods for extracting energy from sources heretofore thought exhausted, as well as deep-sea and off-world resources, Daoming Sochua was presented with numerous international awards before joining the Chinese Bureau of Scientific Revolution, however she would soon take issue with what she would come to describe as a corrupt nepotistic administration. After introduction by fellow researcher Tao Huiqing she would join the Chinese Workers Party in 2195, in what was a controversial move for such a highly placed researcher.\n\nAfter the Chengdu uprising and its brutal suppression by the Central Government she would resign her position in the Bureau in protest, moving to Chongqing with many fellow revolutionaries where CWP support and influence was strong enough to prevent direct intervention by the Chinese People’s Party. She would take a senior position in the Worker’s standing committee, aligning herself with the Cooperative wing of Party and later becoming its de-facto figurehead."
