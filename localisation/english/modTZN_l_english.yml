  TZN_children_of_africa:0 "Children Of Africa"
  TZN_children_of_africa_desc:0 "The East African Federation is the direct successor state to the old African Union, which fell apart during the Congo Crisis of 2134. Although rife with nativist sentiments, anti-unification thought, and other backwards belief that would leave Africa in the dust, the Federation still clings to the hope of one day unifying the continent.\n\nIndeed, with each passing day, that possibility shifts into the realm of inevitability. The EAF wields the largest industrial base on the continent, the second largest land force in the world, and a rapidly modernizing society. The Pan-African Dream has not died, but flourished."
  TZN_abtbia:0 "ABTBIA"
  TZN_abtbia_desc:0 "The ABTBIA, or the African Board for Trade, Business, and other Internal Affairs, is the government body responsible for managing the economy. It has 50 seats, 40 of which are elected on a regional level and 10 of which are appointed by the President. However, there have been talks (mainly spearheaded by urban elites) for expanding the ABTBIA to 75 seats, as a way of better representing the Federation's diverse population.\n\nThe Board carries out regulation for public companies, sets financial standards and provides counsel to Parliament on relevant matters. All other oversight boards are required to file reports to the ABTBIA and many have their directors appointed by a ABTBIA vote. Recently, the Board has taken a special interest in heavy industry and the Pan-African infrastructure sector."

 #Leaders
  TZN_jama_samatar:0 "Jama Samatar"
  TZN_jama_samatar_desc:0 "Avuncular, genial, affable, affecting an air of bonhomie, Jama Samatar wished to be addressed as Kubwa Mjomba - "great uncle" in Swahili - by those he both commanded and protected. Despite his seeming benevolence and absent-minded demeanor, he was nonetheless an efficient and effective administrator, an able diplomat, and ruthless (when necessary). Samatar was amused and likely pleased when detractors likened him to the traditional African village chieftains of the past, claiming him to be a throwback and out-of-step with the new world in the wake of the Great Mistake.\n\nRising from the poverty and violence of the inundated streets of Hargeisa, Samatar joined the African Union's resurgent military forces, eventually rising to the rank of Major. For three decades he served in a variety of increasingly important posts, military and civilian, rising steadily in both ability and influence. He was able to overcome lingering tribal tensions, dealing with the polyglot cultures of Africa with both reverence and common sense. Jama Samatar proved to be just as efficient against any perceived threat to the well-being and safety of those under his protection. In dealing with nascent warlords, religious fanatics, and local dictators, he either brought about an equitable peace, or bludgeoned them into submission. Although never known as a military genius, his troops were extremely loyal to their "great uncle" and fought with abandon for his approval. Samatar never lost a battle, although he took no credit for his victories and viewed them as lamentable necessities. Though not religious himself, he has been tolerant and accepting of others' religious traditions."

Pollution, overfishing and a warming climate have left aquatic ecosystems in disarray, bringing ruination to the communities that once relied on them to survive.

While we do agree that a united Africa is in our best interests, this cannot come at the cost of national identities. Pushing for greater recognition of national cultures will ensure that Africa remains a vibrant land, rather than a monotone one."

Not when it was what spelled the end of the African Union of old."
  TZN_beyond_the_homeland:0 "Beyond The Homeland"

Though many would have written it off after the Great Mistake, it has made remarkable progress towards reunifying and rebuilding. Establishing a diplomatic presence there will ensure that we are on at least comfortable terms with whoever comes out on top, securing a foothold in an economy rising from the ashes."
