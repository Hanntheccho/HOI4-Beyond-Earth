 CUA_war_on_the_future_desc:0 "This District is defined by its struggle against overwhelming technological progress. Beset on all sides by foreign concepts such as "augmentation", "artificial intelligence", and "space colonization". This will not do.\n\nMiriam Godwinson, her clique of supporters, and former Central overseers form a high council bent on keeping the District safe at any cost. If that means banning augmentation technology, forcing society to exist on a semi-modernized level, or keeping unholy technology at bay, so be it. Preachers of many faiths travel the South's streets, spreading word of the dangers or unbridled progress."

 CUA_miriam_godwinson_desc:0 "Miriam Godwinson was born in what was once Georgia, 2146. Her father was a high-ranking minister in the Evangelical Fire, one of the apocalyptic sects that appeared in local communities after the turn of the century. Baptized in River of Fire at age 7, she attended a series of religious schools, culminating in a degree in theology from the College of the Covenant and a doctorate in psychology from Newland University. By the time Godwinson began her own ministry, the Evangelical Fire was the largest Christian denomination in her home region. By the age of 26, she was the ranking Psych Priest of the Heavenly Diocese, third most senior member of the sect. In 2174, she volunteered to serve with Central "reintegration forces" sent to the North. Appointed Central District Honorary Psych Chaplain, she proved to be a talented military psychologist, but at the same time, her religious ministry to the desperate people of the region backfired.\n\nUpon returning to the South, millions hailed her as a kind of messiah (the Prophet Phenomenon often coinciding with post-Mistake madness), forcing Central to release her from service before her presence could further inflame local religious mania. Authorities were reluctant to have such a controversial figure in a high leadership position in the District, but political pressure from the communities for the reconciling of the secular and the spiritual forced them to consider her for the position of Psych Chaplain. Her undeniable talent for that role eventually won her the appointment. Merriam is a relic of a different age. She values order and morality, and is always at odds with the march of progress. Humanity is but a child in her eyes, running from home into the great unknown."
