  bolivar.8.t:0 "Changing Of The Guard"
  bolivar.8.d:0 "No one could deny it, not even Harry Abdool himself. President of Bolivaria ever since the Revolution of 2179, Mr. Abdool knew the dangers of the outside world all too well. And now, despite his herculean effort to keep the tide of history at bay, the bulwark was shattering. Bolivaria , through fault of no one in particular, was liberalizing.\n\nThe signs were small at first, like shadows on the periphery. Nonetheless, Mr. Abdool blamed himself for allowing them to grow. As the years took their toll on the old government, the President buried friend after friend. The changing of the guard began with the ascension of Reynaldo Avelino to Parliament in 2188. His allies followed suit. Mr. Abdool, secluded in his high office and preoccupied with more important matters, woke up one sunny morning to find his people divided. Venezuelan and Colombian, Northerner and Southerner, purist and harmonist, they all stood together once. Not anymore. Sometimes, Mr. Abdool allowed self pity to enter his mind, a nagging feeling that ruined his sleep.\n\n’It is a terrible thing,’ he thought, ‘and insulting too. To have preserved everything, only for the young to spit on it. How little they understand of the injustices that pervade this world.’ But the President resolved to stand his ground."
  bolivar.8.a:0 "There is no Bolivaria without Harry Abdool."
  bolivar.9.t:0 "Agricultural Renovation"
  bolivar.9.d:0 "The Great Mistake dealt a great blow to the world economy. With international trade collapsing and the Americans landing on Bolivarian shores, our nation had no choice but to resort to unsustainable farming practices and other things best left in the dustbin of history. Ever since, the only external benefactor to the Bolivarian regime has been the Andean Compact, whose harvester designs are the basis for our own. For over a century, Bolivaria has been on the brink of famine, avoided only by heavy rationing.\n\nHowever, now that the liberalization movement is spreading through the government like wildfire, certain politicians have endorsed the idea of importing outside equipment. New designs from Europe and Africa have been proven sustainable and inflict only minor degradation on soil. Other parts of the government have not been so receptive, calling the proposal ‘unnecessary’ and even ‘dangerous to Bolivaria's stability.’ Instead, the conservative factions of Parliament have proposed to source more Andean designs and initiate a limited ‘self-help’ program by creating new fleets of Bolivarian harvesters."
  bolivar.9.a:0 "Contact with the outside is dangerous and foolish. We can make our own equipment."
  bolivar.9.b:0 "The measure passes. Let’s see what the foreigners have to offer."
  bolivar.9.a.tt:0 "Industrial Power §R-35§!"
  bolivar.9.b.tt:0 "§G+30%§! Stance in the Agricultural branch"
  bolivar.10.t:0 "Proper Debates"
  bolivar.10.d:0 "Filibustering was originally illegalized in Bolivaria during the American Invasion, when the old president activated dictatorial powers and asked Parliament to settle complex issues in a few hours. When the Americans were repulsed, the government gradually grew more conservative on many issues, until the first liberalization wave in the 2170s hit. To deal with a flurry of new proposals and popular bills, some old guard politicians (many the same ones in Parliament today) enacted long speeches and proposed many delays that helped the Revolution take power.\n\nIt is a great tragedy, therefore, that the higher ups bicker over trivial details while their dear Bolivaria stands on the doorstep of a new age. While filibustering is still illegal, the old guard is too entrenched to investigate the issue further. The liberal factions have decided to combine their efforts and force an investigation of all politicians, hoping to press charges of conspiracy against the old guard."
  bolivar.10.a:0 "The investigation succeeds. Some conservative politicians are ousted and filibustering ends."
  bolivar.10.b:0 "The investigation fails. The old guard stands firm and the liberal factions lose credibility."
  bolivar.11.t:0 "The Right To Vote"
  bolivar.11.d:0 "President Abdool wasn’t elected as much as he was ‘approved’ by Bolivaria itself. As the leader and organizer of the Revolution of 2179, Abdool and his clique of supporters were offered high positions of office by the resigning regime. The army, which had participated in the Revolution, approved only when the new President promised the late General Rodriguez a seat in Parliament. Ever since, nation-wide elections have been suspended due to the threat of imminent American invasion. While limited elections still occur on the city-hall level, only prominent politicians and officers are allowed to vote in them. Unsurprisingly, few seats have changed hands over the years.\n\nThe liberal factions, once again, have a radical plan on dealing with this conundrum. Representative Avelino of the Communalist faction plans to make use of his connections in newspapers and broadcasting agencies to inform the citizenry of their lack of power. The liberals hope that, by radicalizing the masses, the old guard will have no choice but to open local elections to all. The only issue now is whether to move on with this plan. Should it fail, perhaps as a result of low popular traction or high office interference, the liberal factions stand to lose many useful connections."
  bolivar.11.a:0 "The plan goes through. Change can only happen with the people by our side."
  bolivar.11.b:0 "The plan is too risky. Call it off."
  bolivar.12.t:0 "Villages Flip"
  bolivar.12.d:0 "Success! The media campaign worked as expected. Representative Avelino and his clique have, via bribery and the invocation of old favors, managed to exert sufficient influence on the people so as to radicalize them. Across the South and West, villagers have engaged in protests for their rights. Conspiracy theories are now floating to the highest reaches of government, and instability in the South cannot be ignored. It is only a matter of time before the government will be forced to concede the elections and allow popular voting."
  bolivar.12.a:0 "Let democracy shine brighter!"
  bolivar.12.tt:0 "§G+20%§! Stance in the Cultural branch"
  bolivar.13.t:0 "Apathetic Citizens"
  bolivar.13.d:0 "The media campaign couldn’t gather sufficient traction so as to flip the rural villages to the liberal cause. While censorship played a significant part, as 41 of the 50 proposed informational programs aired, ultimately the people simply chose to ignore the message. When President Abdool found out about the attempt, he demanded the replacement of station chiefs, dashing all hopes of mass popular representation within the month."
  bolivar.13.a:0 "Their loss."
  bolivar.13.tt:0 "§R-40%§! Stance in the Cultural branch"
  bolivar.14.t:0 "More Muscle"
  bolivar.14.d:0 "Every politician in Bolivaria is assigned a bodyguard, no matter their rank. As the bodyguards tend to be hired from a pool of former military personnel, their loyalty lies with High Command, and therefore with President Abdool. In the event that a coup becomes necessary, or to protect themselves from purges, the liberals have put forward their own bodyguard candidates in place of the old ones, who are due for retirement soon. While the Minister of Security is responsible for assigning bodyguards, he is known to be sympathetic to the liberal cause."
  bolivar.14.a:0 "Fresh guards are assigned to party members."
  bolivar.14.b:0 "There is no need for this. Bring back the original bodyguards."
  bolivar.14.a.tt:0 "§G+4%§! daily trend in the Security branch"
  bolivar.14.b.tt:0 "§R-2%§! daily trend in the Security branch"
  bolivar.15.t:0 "Political Assassinations"
  bolivar.15.d:0 "Following the height of the American invasion of the 2080’s, many old Venezuelan soldiers fled to the Southern jungles and mountains, hoping to regroup there and launch a counterattack. The attempt failed due to poor leadership and low supplies. Thus, the soldiers settled down and fortified their new homes. Years turned into decades, until the troops themselves withered and died, but not before establishing a local martial tradition. These villages, while isolated, contain well-trained and militarized civilians who, on occasion, outsource their services to the Party during purges.\n\nIf the liberal factions can make contact with the villages and gain their allegiance, they will have gained a valuable ally should push come to shove and a purge be carried out. However, the loyalty of these assassins is questionable at best and they may just sell their contracts out to the government."
  bolivar.15.a:0 "Let’s try to make a deal."
  bolivar.15.b:0 "There will be no negotiation with mercenaries!"
  bolivar.16.t:0 "A New Ally"
  bolivar.16.d:0 "Representative Avelino has dispatched a delegate to the Southern provinces in search of the mercenary strongholds. After many weeks of travel, he stumbled upon a village hidden within a dying rainforest. After careful deliberation with the locals, the delegate has secured a successful transaction.\n\nSeveral days have already passed without word from either the government or mercenaries, implying that the latter has not sold out their new allies. The liberal factions can now rely on some extra muscle to insure themselves against a potential purge."
  bolivar.16.a:0 "Very good!"
  bolivar.16.tt:0 "§G+20%§! Stance in the Security branch"
  bolivar.17.t:0 "The Price of Betrayal"
  bolivar.17.d:0 "Representative Avelino has dispatched a delegate to the Southern provinces in search of the mercenary strongholds. After many weeks of travel, he stumbled upon a village hidden within a dying rainforest. After careful deliberation with the locals, the delegate has secured a successful transaction.\n\nAfter a period of several days, prominent representatives were arrested on charges of treason and conspiracy. While Representative Avelino and the most powerful liberals have cut all ties with the arrestees, it is quite clear that the Southern assassins have informed the state of the attempted deal."
  bolivar.17.a:0 "A manageable loss."
  bolivar.17.tt:0 "§R-40%§! Stance in the Security branch"
  bolivar.18.t:0 "Red Tape"
  bolivar.18.d:0 "The old regime was prone to American infiltration on all levels of government. To deal with the issue, many security checkpoints, regulations, and bureaucrat exams were drafted to catch spies and deal with generally incompetent individuals. Unfortunately, the times when such measures were necessary are long behind us, and many in the government, from both the conservative and liberal wings, are calling for change. The only resolute defender of the old ways is a small clique of ancient politicians from before the Revolution, who are convinced that extraneous red tape is necessary to ward off American spies by confusing them."
  bolivar.18.a:0 "Just cut the red tape already!"
  bolivar.18.b:0 "This is a hasty and unnecessary action."
  bolivar.18.tt:0 "§G+10%§! Stance in the Parliament branch\n§G+10%§! Stance in the Judiciary branch"
  bolivar.19.t:0 "Where To?"
  bolivar.19.d:0 "Analysis: The former United States of America (also known as the North American Union) is incapable of launching a full-fledged attack on Bolivaria due to its shattered state. The legitimate government in Central wields minimal authority over the continent and cannot be labeled as a credible threat.\n\nAssumption: The North American identity still exists, albeit in a weakened state. Possibility of unification: likely. Threat level of North America is expected to rise exponentially in the following years. Bolivaria lacks the resources and population to win a protracted war in its present state.\n\nProposal: Increased army budget, as drafted by REDACTED, in line with Measure 103 and Measure 236.\n\nProblem: Directional insecurity. Presidential input required.\n\nSolution:"
  bolivar.19.a:0 "Increase land force funding by 25%."
  bolivar.19.b:0 "Double the navy’s budget for the next decade."
  bolivar.19.c:0 "Increase air force funding by 43%."
  bolivar.19.e:0 "Roll back military spending by 8% and reinvest into civilian issues."
  bolivar.19.a.tt:0 "§R-10%§! Stance in the Defense branch"
  bolivar.19.b.tt:0 "§G10%§! Stance in the Defense branch"
  bolivar.20.t:0 "The Conscription Question"
  bolivar.20.d:0 "Analysis: The Bolivarian Land Forces, consisting of several dozen divisions and support brigades, are suffering from Double Cook Syndrome (see attachment). Combat preparedness is insufficient to survive impeding American invasion.\n\nAssumption: A decrease in conscription efforts and an increased focus on individual enlistee quality is the rule among the military powers of the modern world. As quality outmatches quantity, a greater focus should be put on laying off extraneous enlistees.\n\nProposal: Cut in tours and imposed limit on enlistment. Potential elimination of the 16-year old compulsory training program.\n\nProblem: Directional insecurity. Presidential input required.\n\nSolution:"
  bolivar.20.a:0 "Instate army limits. Reroute surplus resources into military R&D."
  bolivar.20.b:0 "Bolivaria is only as strong as its army!"
  bolivar.20.a.tt:0 "§G+25%§! Stance in the Defense branch\nIndustrial Power §G+100§!"
  bolivar.20.b.tt:0 "§R-10%§! Stance in the Defense branch"
  bolivar.21.t:0 "Time Is Up!"
  bolivar.21.d:0 "The Supreme Court of Bolivaria consists of 10 Judges, appointed directly by President Abdool and serving for life, or until their health fails them. It has become apparent, though, that the judges are quite old and not in the same healthy state of mind as they once were. Some, such as Judge Rodriguez, have been falling asleep during hearings and others are believed to be suffering cognitive disorders.\n\nThe reformers have been pushing forward their own selection of judges on the basis of merit, but their loyalty to Harry Abdool is questionable at best. The President himself has drafted a list of candidates, but his close allies in the military are not as approving. The current government is facing too much pressure from all sides and will have to replace the old roster of judges before they make more mistakes."
  bolivar.21.a:0 "Appoint the reformer judges."
  bolivar.21.b:0 "Appoint the President’s favorites."
  bolivar.21.a.tt:0 "§G+25%§! Stance in the Judiciary branch"
  bolivar.21.b.tt:0 "§R-10%§! Stance in the Judiciary branch"
  bolivar.22.t:0 "Mandatory Attendance"
  bolivar.22.d:0 "Across the developed world, education is completed via online classes. Although children are still expected to report to brick and mortar schools from time to time, especially during their formative years, the recent rise in superbugs has driven students indoors. Bolivaria has historically invested in this kind of education, but even today most of the country’s funding goes into defense, leaving only scraps for the nation’s youth. The President himself, in an unexpected twist of fate, has begun campaigning for better school environments. Opponents have slandered the action as having no noble intent in mind, but rather as being a ploy to brainwash the future generations into Abdool’s servitude. It remains to be seen whether Harry Abdool’s push for better education will be approved by Parliament."
  bolivar.22.a:0 "Increase school funding to allow for online interactions."
  bolivar.22.b:0 "That money is better spent on tanks."
  bolivar.22.a.tt:0 "§G+25%§! Stance in the Educational branch"
  bolivar.22.b.tt:0 "§G+10%§! Stance in the Defense branch\nIndustrial Power §G+10§!" 
  bolivar.23.t:0 "The Furnace And The Farm"
  bolivar.23.d:0 "Even before the Revolution of 2179, Bolivaria had tried to preserve the natural beauty of its land. From the rainforests of the Amazon to the Andes, the complex ecosystem of our nation is a sight to behold. Travelers passing through the high mountain ranges can only stare in awe at the world below them, surrounded by bitter mists. Descending, one might come upon a forest shrouding a completely different world of animals, insects, exotic birds and isolated tribes.\n\nBut that world is dying. And despite our best efforts, total ecological collapse is expected within the decade. This has led many leading politicians to advocate for a renewed industrialization campaign. This will entail the uprooting of ancient forests to make room for suburban settlements, the conversion of wildlife reserves into commercial parks, and a dramatic increase in fishing. Under Measure 349 the country will be turned into an industrial furnace that can lead us to future victories - but at the cost of the Fatherland that we hold dear."
  bolivar.23.a:0 "Approved. May Mother Earth forgive us."
  bolivar.23.b:0 "Negative. We do not compromise on our ideals."
  bolivar.24.t:0 "The Furnace And The Farm"
  bolivar.24.d:0 "Yesterday, the Minister of Transportation announced a groundbreaking megaproject that will link the old capitals of Bogota and old Caracas through the capital of Bolivar. Costing over 10% of the national GDP, the stated aim of building the 10-lane road through historically virgin forests is to make mobility easier for the average Bolivarian, as well as showing to the world Bolivaria's unity and strength. By linking the Atlantic and Pacific, the project resembles that of the old North’s own initiative to build roads across their nation.\n\nThe highway will be built along the rim of the Amazon Rainforest before crossing the Colombian Andes and finishing at the Ecuadorian border. Several smaller roads will also be built to link the highway to surrounding communities and businesses. Alongside these roads, utilities and rail lines will also be built, improving the capacity for the central government to move resources around.\n\nThe project has already gathered denunciation from Brazil and the Andean Compact, as it is seen as a continuation of the Bolivaraian policy to exploit the Amazon Rainforest, deepening the ecological damage caused by similar activities. Independent groups and autonomous communities have also expressed their concern that the road may bring government forces closer to home, threatening their independence."
  bolivar.24.a:0 "Fixing Bolivaria, one road at a time."
  bolivar.25.t:0 "Slippage"
  bolivar.25.d:0 "Locals in Bolivarian Amazonia have rioted after conspiracy theorists blamed a recent 4.3 magnitude earthquake on mining activities in the region, specifically the use of boreholes. Despite the technology being proven to have drastically reduced environmental impact relative to pre-Mistake industry, and said industry itself being worth over 70% of the region's income, the rioters continue to insist that the boreholes destabilize the structural integrity of the land. It is hypothesized that the agitation comes from foreign mining companies, whose traditional mines in the region continue to deforest large stretches of the remaining Amazon. Boreholes have improved on the traditional pit mining by reducing the surface area of the entrance hole, whilst allowing both a deep and wide mine to be created below. This method has been used widely across the world, and is a marvel of modern engineering."

On the other hand, some innovation still exists throughout the companies of Bolivaria.\n\nThe most important of them are Research and Development companies, who specialize in discovering new and effective methods of killing in case the Americans invade again. However, with some minor reforms and bribes, these companies can refocus their efforts on other studies such as construction, management, and engineering."
  COL_streamline_gunsmithies:0 "Streamline Gunsmithies"
  COL_streamline_gunsmithies_desc:0 "Originally, the old countries of South America imported their weapons from powers like old America and Great China. But once the Great Mistake reached their shores, gun production had to become internal. As the situation worsened and economies buckled further, the role of the gunsmith became very important in society, for they could manufacture the means by which a person or village may defend themselves. Thus, over the decades, gunsmithing has become somewhat of a family art.\n\nThis needs to change. Domestic production is quite low, and some countries continue to reject automation in fear of angering existing gunsmiths, who are more necessary than ever in today’s boiling world. Fortunately, the wise Bolivarian government has come up with a compromise: instead of completely automating the gunsmithing trade, existing smiths will be able to collaborate in newly designed factories (instead of plying their trade in personal stores). This production chain should greatly accelerate weapons manufacturing."
  COL_privatize_railways:0 "Privatize Railways"
  COL_privatize_railways_desc:0 "Currently, local governments manage infrastructure concerns across most of Bolivaria. While this is sound on paper, the lack of market interference has resulted in the sector becoming oversaturated with weak roads used almost exclusively for military traffic.

The hope is that, with business management, the quality of infrastructure will improve drastically."
