  COL_ezequiel_leon_desc:0 "To call Ezequiel León the face of the United Bolivarian Republic would not be entirely metaphorical. The man's features grace much of the country's ubiquitous propaganda, having served as president dutifully and competently for decades. Like all Bolivarians, he was instilled with a sense of national duty since birth, and even as president has been unwavering in his devotion to the country. Under his watchful eye and firm leadership, the people of Bolivaria have readied themselves for the day that the Americans would return for the lands they tried to seize in the days before the Great Mistake.\n\nBut it has been a very, very long time since then. And what little intelligence comes in from the north paints a much different portrait of America to the propaganda. León is left entertaining the all-too-plausible idea that the Americans - the long-time boogeymen Bolivaria is united in preparing for - are not coming. Hesitant as he is to dismiss such an existential threat on mere conjecture, the paranoia of Bolivarian politics forces him to plan for every contingency. His beloved country was forged in crisis, and has remained in a precarious position since. The way things are in Bolivaria may not be ideal or even sustainable, but for a nation to find out it had been built on a lie would not come without consequences."

Falsely proclaiming liberation, the Northerners ravaged our lands and people. But then, in our darkest hour, something beautiful happened... Our people, from multiple nations, formed one union and fought off the invader. When the Americans and their corporate masters return, they will find a united and ready Bolivaria."

  bolivar.8.t:0 "Changing Of The Guard"
  bolivar.8.d:0 "No one could deny it, not even Ezequiel León himself. President of Bolivaria ever since the Revolution of 2179, Mr. León knew the dangers of the outside world all too well. And now, despite his herculean effort to keep the tide of history at bay, the bulwark was shattering. Bolivaria, through fault of no one in particular, was liberalizing.\n\nThe signs were small at first, like shadows on the periphery. Nonetheless, Mr. León blamed himself for allowing them to grow. As the years took their toll on the old government, the President buried friend after friend. The changing of the guard began with the ascension of Reynaldo Avelino to Parliament in 2188. His allies followed suit. Mr. León, secluded in his high office and preoccupied with more important matters, woke up one sunny morning to find his people divided. Venezuelan and Colombian, Northerner and Southerner, they all stood together once. Not anymore. Sometimes, Mr. León allowed self pity to enter his mind, a nagging feeling that ruined his sleep.\n\n’It is a terrible thing,’ he thought, ‘and insulting too. To have preserved everything, only for the young to spit on it. How little they understand of the injustices that pervade this world.’ But the President resolved to stand his ground."
  bolivar.8.a:0 "There is no Bolivaria without Ezequiel León."
  bolivar.9.t:0 "Agricultural Renovation"
  bolivar.9.d:0 "The Great Mistake dealt a great blow to the world economy. With international trade collapsing and the Americans landing on Bolivarian shores, our nation had no choice but to resort to unsustainable farming practices and other things best left in the dustbin of history. Ever since, the only external benefactor to the Bolivarian regime has been the Andean Compact, whose harvester designs are the basis for our own. For over a century, Bolivaria has been on the brink of famine, avoided only by heavy rationing.\n\nHowever, now that the liberalization movement is spreading through the government like wildfire, certain politicians have endorsed the idea of importing outside equipment. New designs from Europe and Africa have been proven sustainable and inflict only minor degradation on soil. Other parts of the government have not been so receptive, calling the proposal ‘unnecessary’ and even ‘dangerous to Bolivaria's stability.’ Instead, the conservative factions of Parliament have proposed to source more Andean designs and initiate a limited ‘self-help’ program by creating new fleets of Bolivarian harvesters."
  bolivar.9.a:0 "Contact with the outside is dangerous and foolish. We can make our own equipment."
  bolivar.9.b:0 "The measure passes. Let’s see what the foreigners have to offer."

  bolivar.10.t:0 "Proper Debates"
  bolivar.10.d:0 "Filibustering was originally illegalized in Bolivaria during the American Invasion, when the old president activated dictatorial powers and asked Parliament to settle complex issues in a few hours. When the Americans were repulsed, the government gradually grew more conservative on many issues, until the first liberalization wave in the 2170s hit. To deal with a flurry of new proposals and popular bills, some old guard politicians (many the same ones in Parliament today) enacted long speeches and proposed many delays that helped the Revolution take power.\n\nIt is a great tragedy, therefore, that the higher ups bicker over trivial details while their dear Bolivaria stands on the doorstep of a new age. While filibustering is still illegal, the old guard is too entrenched to investigate the issue further. The liberal factions have decided to combine their efforts and force an investigation of all politicians, hoping to press charges of conspiracy against the old guard."
  bolivar.10.a:0 "The investigation succeeds. Some conservative politicians are ousted and filibustering ends."
  bolivar.10.b:0 "The investigation fails. The old guard stands firm and the liberal factions lose credibility."
  bolivar.11.t:0 "The Right To Vote"
  bolivar.11.d:0 "President León wasn’t elected as much as he was ‘approved’ by Bolivaria itself. As the leader and organizer of the Revolution of 2179, León and his clique of supporters were offered high positions of office by the resigning regime. The army, which had participated in the Revolution, approved only when the new President promised the late General Rodriguez a seat in Parliament. Ever since, nation-wide elections have been suspended due to the threat of imminent American invasion. While limited elections still occur on the city-hall level, only prominent politicians and officers are allowed to vote in them. Unsurprisingly, few seats have changed hands over the years.\n\nThe liberal factions, once again, have a radical plan on dealing with this conundrum. Representative Avelino of the Communalist faction plans to make use of his connections in newspapers and broadcasting agencies to inform the citizenry of their lack of power. The liberals hope that, by radicalizing the masses, the old guard will have no choice but to open local elections to all. The only issue now is whether to move on with this plan. Should it fail, perhaps as a result of low popular traction or high office interference, the liberal factions stand to lose many useful connections."
  bolivar.11.a:0 "The plan goes through. Change can only happen with the people by our side."
  bolivar.11.b:0 "The plan is too risky. Call it off."
  bolivar.12.t:0 "Villages Flip"
  bolivar.12.d:0 "Success! The media campaign worked as expected. Representative Avelino and his clique have, via bribery and the invocation of old favors, managed to exert sufficient influence on the people so as to radicalize them. Across the South and West, villagers have engaged in protests for their rights. Conspiracy theories are now floating to the highest reaches of government, and instability in the South cannot be ignored. It is only a matter of time before the government will be forced to concede the elections and allow popular voting."

While censorship played a significant part, as 41 of the 50 proposed informational programs aired, ultimately the people simply chose to ignore the message. When President León found out about the attempt, he demanded the replacement of station chiefs, dashing all hopes of mass popular representation within the month."

  bolivar.14.t:0 "More Muscle"
  bolivar.14.d:0 "Every politician in Bolivaria is assigned a bodyguard, no matter their rank. As the bodyguards tend to be hired from a pool of former military personnel, their loyalty lies with High Command, and therefore with President León. In the event that a coup becomes necessary, or to protect themselves from purges, the liberals have put forward their own bodyguard candidates in place of the old ones, who are due for retirement soon. While the Minister of Security is responsible for assigning bodyguards, he is known to be sympathetic to the liberal cause."

  bolivar.15.d:0 "Following the height of the American invasion of the 2080’s, many old Venezuelan soldiers fled to the Southern jungles and mountains, hoping to regroup there and launch a counterattack. The attempt failed due to poor leadership and low supplies. Thus, the soldiers settled down and fortified their new homes. Years turned into decades, until the troops themselves withered and died, but not before establishing a local martial tradition. These villages, while isolated, contain well-trained and militarized civilians who, on occasion, outsource their services to the Party during purges.\n\nIf the liberal factions can make contact with the villages and gain their allegiance, they will have gained a valuable ally should push come to shove and a purge be carried out. However, the loyalty of these assassins is questionable at best and they may just sell their contracts out to the government."
  bolivar.15.a:0 "Let’s try to make a deal."

After many weeks of travel, he stumbled upon a village hidden within a dying rainforest. After careful deliberation with the locals, the delegate has secured a successful transaction.\n\nSeveral days have already passed without word from either the government or mercenaries, implying that the latter has not sold out their new allies. The liberal factions can now rely on some extra muscle to insure themselves against a potential purge."

After many weeks of travel, he stumbled upon a village hidden within a dying rainforest. After careful deliberation with the locals, the delegate has secured a successful transaction.\n\nAfter a period of several days, prominent representatives were arrested on charges of treason and conspiracy. While Representative Avelino and the most powerful liberals have cut all ties with the arrestees, it is quite clear that the Southern assassins have informed the state of the attempted deal."

  bolivar.18.t:0 "Red Tape"
  bolivar.18.d:0 "The old regime was prone to American infiltration on all levels of government. To deal with the issue, many security checkpoints, regulations, and bureaucrat exams were drafted to catch spies and deal with generally incompetent individuals. Unfortunately, the times when such measures were necessary are long behind us, and many in the government, from both the conservative and liberal wings, are calling for change. The only resolute defender of the old ways is a small clique of ancient politicians from before the Revolution, who are convinced that extraneous red tape is necessary to ward off American spies by confusing them."

  bolivar.19.d:0 "Analysis: The former United States of America (also known as the North American Union) is incapable of launching a full-fledged attack on Bolivaria due to its shattered state. The legitimate government in Central wields minimal authority over the continent and cannot be labeled as a credible threat.\n\nAssumption: The North American identity still exists, albeit in a weakened state. Possibility of unification: likely. Threat level of North America is expected to rise exponentially in the following years. Bolivaria lacks the resources and population to win a protracted war in its present state.\n\nProposal: Increased army budget, as drafted by REDACTED, in line with Measure 103 and Measure 236.\n\nProblem: Directional insecurity.

  bolivar.20.d:0 "Analysis: The Bolivarian Land Forces, consisting of several dozen divisions and support brigades, are suffering from Double Cook Syndrome (see attachment). Combat preparedness is insufficient to survive impeding American invasion.\n\nAssumption: A decrease in conscription efforts and an increased focus on individual enlistee quality is the rule among the military powers of the modern world. As quality outmatches quantity, a greater focus should be put on laying off extraneous enlistees.\n\nProposal: Cut in tours and imposed limit on enlistment. Potential elimination of the 16-year old compulsory training program.\n\nProblem: Directional insecurity. Presidential input required.\n\nSolution:"

  bolivar.21.d:0 "The Supreme Court of Bolivaria consists of 10 Judges, appointed directly by President León and serving for life, or until their health fails them. It has become apparent, though, that the judges are quite old and not in the same healthy state of mind as they once were. Some, such as Judge Rodriguez, have been falling asleep during hearings and others are believed to be suffering cognitive disorders.\n\nThe reformers have been pushing forward their own selection of judges on the basis of merit, but their loyalty to Ezequiel León is questionable at best. The President himself has drafted a list of candidates, but his close allies in the military are not as approving. The current government is facing too much pressure from all sides and will have to replace the old roster of judges before they make more mistakes."

  bolivar.22.d:0 "Across the developed world, education is completed via online classes. Although children are still expected to report to brick and mortar schools from time to time, especially during their formative years, the recent rise in superbugs has driven students indoors. Bolivaria has historically invested in this kind of education, but even today most of the country’s funding goes into defense, leaving only scraps for the nation’s youth. The President himself, in an unexpected twist of fate, has begun campaigning for better school environments. Opponents have slandered the action as having no noble intent in mind, but rather as being a ploy to brainwash the future generations into León’s servitude. It remains to be seen whether Ezequiel León’s push for better education will be approved by Parliament."

  bolivar.23.d:0 "Even before the Revolution of 2179, Bolivaria had tried to preserve the natural beauty of its land. From the rainforests of the Amazon to the Andes, the complex ecosystem of our nation is a sight to behold. Travelers passing through the high mountain ranges can only stare in awe at the world below them, surrounded by bitter mists. Descending, one might come upon a forest shrouding a completely different world of animals, insects, exotic birds and isolated tribes.\n\nBut that world is dying. And despite our best efforts, total ecological collapse is expected within the decade. This has led many leading politicians to advocate for a renewed industrialization campaign. This will entail the uprooting of ancient forests to make room for suburban settlements, the conversion of wildlife reserves into commercial parks, and a dramatic increase in fishing. Under Measure 349 the country will be turned into an industrial furnace that can lead us to future victories - but at the cost of the Fatherland that we hold dear."
  bolivar.23.a:0 "Approved. May Mother Earth forgive us."
  bolivar.23.b:0 "Negative. We do not compromise on our ideals."
  bolivar.24.t:0 "The Furnace And The Farm"
  bolivar.24.d:0 "Yesterday, the Minister of Transportation announced a groundbreaking megaproject that will link the old capitals of Bogota and old Caracas through the capital of Bolivar. Costing over 10% of the national GDP, the stated aim of building the 10-lane road through historically virgin forests is to make mobility easier for the average Bolivarian, as well as showing to the world Bolivaria's unity and strength. By linking the Atlantic and Pacific, the project resembles that of the old North’s own initiative to build roads across their nation.\n\nThe highway will be built along the rim of the Amazon Rainforest before crossing the Colombian Andes and finishing at the Ecuadorian border. Several smaller roads will also be built to link the highway to surrounding communities and businesses. Alongside these roads, utilities and rail lines will also be built, improving the capacity for the central government to move resources around.\n\nThe project has already gathered denunciation from Brazil and the Andean Compact, as it is seen as a continuation of the Bolivaraian policy to exploit the Amazon Rainforest, deepening the ecological damage caused by similar activities. Independent groups and autonomous communities have also expressed their concern that the road may bring government forces closer to home, threatening their independence."

  bolivar.25.t:0 "Slippage"
  bolivar.25.d:0 "Locals in Bolivarian Amazonia have rioted after conspiracy theorists blamed a recent 4.3 magnitude earthquake on mining activities in the region, specifically the use of boreholes. Despite the technology being proven to have drastically reduced environmental impact relative to pre-Mistake industry, and said industry itself being worth over 70% of the region's income, the rioters continue to insist that the boreholes destabilize the structural integrity of the land. It is hypothesized that the agitation comes from foreign mining companies, whose traditional mines in the region continue to deforest large stretches of the remaining Amazon. Boreholes have improved on the traditional pit mining by reducing the surface area of the entrance hole, whilst allowing both a deep and wide mine to be created below. This method has been used widely across the world, and is a marvel of modern engineering."
  bolivar.25.a:0 "What are they thinking!?"
  bolivar.29.t:0 "History Lessons"
  bolivar.29.d:0 "The early sun peered through the blinds of the student dormitories. Salarez Parra had already been awake studying from ‘Mecatrónica del Campo de Batalla’ for hours as the rest of his dormitory was quiet with the rare silence of sleep. The smell of clean metal and the sound of boots on the cold floor was the life of so many other people he knew. His older brother was already a trained GOAT-squadron medic, deployed in the interior to set up clinics for refugees and citizens, while his sister had excelled in digital design since winning several competitions in developing battle training software. The sergeant’s wake-up call had surely cured them of any will to study, fight and train to be patriotic heroes. The San Cristóbal Military College was busy with cadets, students, and busses… the usual Monday morning. Wearing full citizen gear complete with the private’s tie – a mandatory show of service to the country - Salarez passed through the security gates. The first lesson of the day was Sermón popular. ‘The trials of the monster across the gulf were severe. Since the days of the great war in Europa caused by the Washington Plutócratas, the Estados Unidos had not been satisfied with the wealth it made from war. The Red talons sought to pillage and enslave the people of the Americas much like the Imperialists that came to destroy and corrupt the first children’s relationship to our land. The lives of our families were lost to the inhuman tactics Estados Unidos used to crush the spirit of the people during the terror rayado. The Washington Caudillos suppressed the people from the Gulf of Maracaibo to the forests of Brazil. They sought to control us by selling drugs and arms, only to then invade us. They lied to the world, and the world couldn’t disagree, else they’d suffer the same fate. The people of Cuba were the first to free themselves from hegemonía del Norte. In July 1953 the revolution against the puppet-presidency of Fulgencio Batista had sought to secure Cuba from the talons. Unfortunately, the people of the island had desired their freedom so badly, that they turned to other foreign powers and ideas to rule them. We, like them, have struggled to free ourselves not only from American imperialism but also the chaos of foreign ideas. Dividing brother against brother, separating mother from daughter, and corrupting our children to leave their fatherland. The war for ideology had raged since the foreign dictatorships clumsily collapsed into a race to pick at the corpse of our nation. We were not alone either, as many more would be lost following the crises of the 21st century. But today is a new day, and we must work to make sure that there will be another.’"
  bolivar.29.a:0 "The outside world is a very dangerous place."
  bolivar.30.t:0 "Final Exams"
  bolivar.30.d:0 "Salarez had finished his mechanics class in the Aerospace engineering complex when he looked on the rostered deployment table for the end-of-semester exam trials. He’d be tested on his ability to survive with his classmates in the wilderness of Nariño province. He wasn’t nervous about his deployment, as the flight was fairly simple. But he was worried whether combat class really reflected survival in jungle environments. He should have taken the extra elective in jungle training to learn how to fight without a weapon, but it clashed with the civilian care unit that taught how to negotiate, console and protect civilian supporters in combat environments. He liked it because it reminded him of the movie ‘Battlehearts of Caracas’, where the protagonist had secured an entire apartment complex and its people with a platoon of soldiers throughout the month-long American occupation by using household items to trap Yanke soldiers. It was his inspiration to go into the combat engineer service path after regional schooling.\n\nHis reminiscing turned to revision as he moved to the next social history class. A rapid-essay quiz on the First Administration era: ‘The reawakening of our people and the journey to restore our fatherland began with the people of what was Venezuela. Struggling in the swamp of foreign ideas, the socialist government of Garcia Hernandez had hoarded power and wealth harvested from the body of the motherland and the blood of the people. Resistance against Hernandez and his thieves grew in the late 2060s, including the brave protestors who died for our nation. The violent end for this red-charade came from their own greedy and ignorant decision to gamble with the lives of the people. A propaganda war to keep power. The Cúcuta conference between Colombian President Ramos and Venezuelan leader Duran outlined an alliance and eventual union for both nations, with an emergency council to restore order and protect the lives of civilians across the scarred country.’"
  bolivar.30.a:0 "We must not forget."
  bolivar.31.t:0 "The Great War"
  bolivar.31.d:0 "The Washington Plutócratas decided to strike against what they labeled ‘a threat to democracy and stability in Latin America’ in the late 21st century. The United States had established bases along with the islands off the mainland, including the newly separated La Guajira Island and Falcón Islands. The foreing imperialists targeted Venezuelan urban clusters in the days before the National Union was able to march into Valencia. For a few months, relations remained cold as minor factions were absorbed or bombarded into US compliance in the North of Venezuela, until the National Union had liberated Caracas from enemy occupation.\n\nThat was when the main US offensive began, carried out not with their own troops but with conscripts of local gangs, factions and civil militias directed from local municipalities and crime lords. The depravity of the Red Talons was shown, as they had helped enslave our people to fight each other. The Venezuelan and volunteer Colombian air forces were unable to stop the rain of bombs from above. 23,522 lives were lost across cities as fires raged. Enemy drone strikes crippled local leadership, a cowardly tactic to cut off our nation’s head. The response from us paled in comparison to the US’s barbarity, but we were able to afford peace and security for our people. The counter-attack on La Guajira Island and Falcón Islands had been swift. The military administration was captured, and taken back to Cúcuta to face trial after the war had ended. On the first of January, 2093, the National Union declared the conflict over, but the war for survival was ongoing. Victory for the motherland and peace for her battered children reigned.’"
  bolivar.31.a:0 "The foreign imperialists drowned in their own blood."
  bolivar.32.t:0 "Rebuilding Efforts"
  bolivar.32.d:0 "‘The conclusion of the Great War For National Survival was not a celebrated event. It did not enter the cultural mainstream as a time of peace and rebuilding. There were no national holidays to commemorate the repulsion of the Americans. Instead of happiness and relief, there was only animosity and a sense of impending danger. The people of the newborn Venezuelan-Colombian union understood that an enemy as powerful as the North Americans did not rest. To live through the future, all surviving assets of the war were devoted to preparing for the next one.\n\nIn the cities, anarchy was still the order of the day. Entire neighborhoods were fighting over food, friends accused each other of conspiring with the North Americans during the invasion and there was no harvest for two years due to the fallout from the war. Millions starved to death in the streets, but the country held firm. How else, in a world of such cruelty and malice, can a peace-loving nation survive? The few remaining scholars turned their attention to philosophical matters, trying to rationalize the recent conflict.\n\nWas it true? Did human barbarity know no bounds when presented with riches? Entire schools of thought were developed and utilized by the old regime to explain the war. At the time, many still thought that there was a purpose for the American invasion, that Bolivaria had earned something from the bloodshed. That the sacrifice of millions was not in vain.’"
  bolivar.32.a:0 "‘But of course it was. Survival is not a reward but a burden.’"
  bolivar.33.t:0 "National Revival"
  bolivar.33.d:0 "‘After the Great Mistake, a new term was coined by the German philosopher Sofie Klugman: ‘guilt of the shaken’. Constructed on the foundations of the ancient thinker Jan Patocka, the term was used to describe a sense of survivor’s guilt among the masses. There was not a single person on Earth who had not been in some way affected by the Great Mistake. Whether it was lost family, lost home or lost opportunity, it did not matter. The survivors lived out their days with the nagging feeling of regret - that something could have been done, but was not. That the ultimate injustice was to remain idle while the world was set ablaze.\n\nSimilarly, this ‘guilt of the shaken’ held true for the Bolivarians following the American War. Many veterans felt that they did not do enough. Many more civilians lived with the emotional burden of loss, perpetuated by the sense of easing tensions. When the old government began to grow soft, the National Revival Front launched their Great Revolution of 2179. Some criticized the new regime. They said that there was no use in grief, that the nation had to move on. That the Americans were gone too and that there was no new war coming. But the brave President León saw through the dissidents’ deception. A nation is only as good as its people, and what are a people that forget the injustices inflicted upon them, upon their ancestors? For Bolivaria to stand, the North Americans must fall. They will attack soon, that is certain. Only when they are defeated a second time, pushed back and their fatherland itself is occupied, will there be justice on this Earth. Until then, we must prepare, for the sake of the shaken."

  bolivar.34.d:0 "Carlos Jose, the famous leader of the ‘White Cat’ drug cartel has been planning a raid on a nationalized food processing plant located in a village near Bogota. He has been a ‘Serpent under the Flower’, smiling in front of cameras and expressing his love for the government. For a time, he did genuinely support the government, although generous donations didn’t give him what he wanted: rare chemicals required for food-processing, relics from the old world. However, not wanting to risk unsavory publicity with an open raid on government facilities, luck came to Jose.\n\nThe students of the University of Bogota had been planning a protest against the government for months, but some had been demanding more drastic action. Organized by a currently  unidentified man, the students are believed to have contacted the ‘White Cat’ cartel and organized a deal. A security camera in Warehouse 408 of Lesser Bogota identified at least 30 students entering and later leaving with rifles. Before the police could respond, a fire broke out in a local food processing plant. A fire brigade was hastily organized, but by the time they had arrived, the majority of the building was burned down and the freezer was empty. Workers confirmed that the arson was carried out by the armed students. A complete report is difficult to piece together, but it seems that, at roughly 8 p.m., a group of 12 students and 3 well known bandits entered the building and set off an explosive near the freezer. No lives were lost, but the damage was extensive and local communities will have to subsist on canned goods for several months."

The damage is still being calculated, but at least 3,865 people have died and tens of thousands more were injured. Labeled ‘Incident 118’, this chain of arsons, mass murders and sabotage is believed to have been carried out by dissident groups consisting of disgruntled students, criminal organizations, and North American sabetours. This is the 6th organized attack this year, and by far the most damaging. Affected were:\n\n-43 food processing facilities\n-3 steel mills/n-4 armories\n-2 fire stations\n-and 1 police station.\n\nThe attacks have coincided with large protests in urban clusters. The liberal parties have condemned the attack as reckless murder, but have also criticezed President León’s handling of the situation. Police units and coastal garrisons were called in to scatter the protestors and search all buildings near the attacked areas for the perpetrators. The usual suspects are already behind bars, but it would not be foolish to accept that the true perpetrators are still at large. The media has been contacted and will report the sabotage as being almost entirely the North Americans’ fault. Military buildup along the coast will be tripled to pay for this disaster."

The Police have already rounded up the usual suspects: The first is the son of a North American refugee, previously incarcerated for theft; the second is a police officer with extensive ties to the liberal factions (specifically the Harmonists) and the last is an Amazonian native suspected of being an assassin-for-hire.

  bolivar.37.d:0 "The police line stood well back from the protestors, as though engaged in some unspoken agreement with them. Just as the Policía Metropolitana de Bogotá stayed their hand, the protestors kept away from the cordon. Not that this did much to dampen their ferocity, as the air filled with a cacophony of chanted slogans, blaring protest songs and beating drums. The wall of noise crescendoed into a cheer as someone hoisted an Andean flag on a pole, already smoldering from being set alight. \n\n ‘Be advised, the protestors have lit a flag on fire,’ Sergeant Hernandez stated into his radio. ‘Keep an eye out in case someone gets burnt. If they do, make a show of helping them out. We’re under orders to let this play out.’\n\n A handful of acknowledgements came back over the radio, but his caution proved unnecessary. The Andean flag burned without a hitch, much to the delight of the motley bunch of protestors. Be they fresh-faced students still in their uniforms or older nationalists proudly wearing the Bolivarian flag, they happily partook in casting down the burnt remnants of the Andean flag and stomping out any lingering embers. \n\n Hernandez glanced at the officers around him, pleased to see that they were maintaining their professionalism. All except Officer Pacheco beside him, whose brow was visibly furrowed even behind his plexiglass visor. \n\n ‘Problem, Pacheco?’ Hernandez asked, all but shouting to be heard over the noise. ‘Speak freely.’  \n\n The younger officer shook his head. ‘No, sir. It’s just… we’ve bought a lot of weapons from the Andeans. With the Americans breathing down our necks, this seems a bit rash.’ \n\n Frowning, Hernandez indicated a placard that one of the protestors was holding. It held two pie charts - one showing the percentage of farms owned by Andean versus non-Andean interests, while the other showed the percentage of crop yields by those two same groups. For such a large degree of ownership, the Andeans didn’t seem to contribute much. n/n/ ‘They are parasites, Pacheco,’ Hernandez said. ‘They sell us cheap weapons specifically to hold power over us. Then they come and buy up our land, and fleece us for the food grown in our own soil! They’re as bad as the damn Yankees! We have every right to nationalize their so-called businesses!’ \n\n Pacheco shifted his stance, standing straighter. ‘Understood, sir.’ \n\n Hernandez clapped him on the shoulder, turning his attention back to the protestors. He understood the younger man’s concerns. The American threat was ever-present, but it boiled down to one simple factor - independence. And if the Andeans were to threaten that, they were no different."
  bolivar.37.a:0 "The protest continued late into the night, dispersing peacefully with no arrests."
  bolivar.38.t:0 "A Matter of Dependence"
  bolivar.38.d:0 "As the protests had dragged on, President Ezequiel León had mastered the art of tuning out the distant cacophony. \n\n Instead, his attention was rapt on the economists sitting on the other side of his desk. Evidently, they weren’t quite as used to the demonstrations, occasionally glancing out the nearest window whenever a firecracker went off or a siren screamed past. Yet in spite of the distractions, their case was eminently clear. \n\n ‘Nationalization of Andean businesses is our only realistic option,’ said Mr Moreno, gesturing to the report that sat before the president. ‘Their influence over the economy is considerable, especially in industries of public interest such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals. Given current global conditions and the American threat, these sectors would be served better with government protection.’ \n\n Mrs Rojas nodded in agreement. ‘I would go further, in fact. When you factor in the political clout the Andeans currently possess, it’s not unlikely that they could take over the country not just economically, but politically. They may precipitate a crisis by withholding arms exports or creating artificial shortages of food or medicine, all to destabilize our government. The best way to remove that threat is to end our dependence on the Compact and cease all ties with them.’ \n\n As the pair spoke, President León looked over the figures again, though it was only to hide his retreat into his thoughts. There’d been a time when such talk was unthinkable. Back then, the Andean Compact had been a great ally in an uncertain world. Or, at least, not an opportunistic vulture circling overhead. Simpler times, to be sure. But there could be no turning back of the clock. \n\n ‘Breaking ties would be no small step,’ President León said. ‘Surely nationalization would send a sufficient message.’ \n\n Mr Moreno shrugged. ‘It would carry consequences as well. But it would also be a partial measure to a wider problem. The risk of takeover is not inconsiderable. The Compact has every motivation to secure their flank with a friendly regime, especially with the Brazilians breathing down their neck. Just as they have every motivation to profit from our resources, even if it comes at our expense.’ \n\n President León sighed, this time examining the report again properly. The figures were sobering. Andean influence was already dominating industries best not left in the hands of foreign interests. If it grew, there would be no telling the consequences. \n\n The president nodded, and looked up to give his answer. ‘Very well. We will nationalize Andean businesses…’"
  bolivar.38.a:0 "‘... but we will maintain ties with them. Let’s not overreact to a complex situation.’"

  bolivar.41.d:0 "The evening rarely brought much change in the temperature these days. Hot nights and hotter days were the norm in a very warm, very human era. But Mauricio was used to it. He settled in at his post in the guard tower, watching over the road and its checkpoint. There was little traffic that time of evening. Sometimes, it was as though he and the men serving under him were nothing more than glorified human scarecrows.\n\nHe hadn’t wanted it to be that way. He’d wanted to get into politics. To give Bolivaria some fighting chance at surviving the chaotic post-Mistake world, instead of letting his dear country languish in isolationism and militarism. The same isolationism that hampered the import of medicine, forcing his mother to ration her doses almost to the point of ineffectiveness. The same militarism that had seen his father conscripted, then caught in a bandit ambush on a food convoy that cost him the use of his legs. Anything that could spare another family the same anguish.\n\nBut it was not to be. The country had made its choice, and would have to live with it.\n\nA truck pulled into the checkpoint, and the soldiers on the ground surrounded it to give the usual check. The driver was interrogated and his papers checked. Mauicio recognized him - it was Old Man Arturo. The man had been delivering food to a town just over the border longer than Mauritio had been alive. Arturo even slipped the guards pieces of fruit on the rare occasion that the harvests were plentiful. And yet, he was being subject to a level of scrutiny and distrust that treated him as a possible American agent.\n\nMauricio grit his teeth, and radioed the soldiers on the checkpoint to vouch for Arturo. A couple of the soldiers looked up at the guard tower with something approaching suspicion, but quickly let the man pass. After all, who were they to doubt their commanding officer? He’d worked hard to work his way through the ranks."

  bolivar.42.t:0 "The Killing Fields"
  bolivar.42.d:0 "The village was utterly unremarkable by Bolivarian standards. It had been hastily erected more than a century ago to house refugees from the American invasion and rising sea levels. Wood and stone had been joined by any building material the locals could get their hands on in the Dark Days, from scrap metal made out of military materiel to old billboards advertising goods that had long disappeared from the post-Mistake world. The village had weathered all manner of economic, ecological and political crises over the years, but there’d been precious few good times where it had flourished.\n\nOn the surface of things, life had some normality to it. The children went to the schoolhouse as usual, huddling under its sole functional ceiling fan for their daily lessons on reading, writing, arithmetic and civil defense. Across the street at the increasingly-ancient church, the padre held his early-morning service for the workers about to head out to the farms. As the pews emptied out, the old timers sat in their favorite patches of shade, talking about the ever-nebulous Good Old Days. Others gossiped about the crew that was coming to fix the network node next month - it had broken down so long ago that most people had forgotten it existed.\n\nBut beneath the surface - in the fields, in quiet after-work conversations at the bar, and at increasingly raucous village meetings in the church - the village’s future hung by a thread.\n\nThe crops were failing. There was no other way to describe it. Post-Mistake agriculture was an uphill battle on a hill that kept growing taller and steeper. Each year saw the rains grow a little more unreliable, the pollinators a little fewer in number, and the ground a little more cracked in the heatwaves. That wasn’t to say there weren’t solutions. Some nations had seen great success with genetically modified crops and weather control. Others cut out the middleman, relying on indoor farming.\n\nBut for a poor village in the unfashionable end of Bolivaria, there was nothing more they could do. The water they saved from cutting usage was no longer enough, and the prayers were going unanswered. After a particularly heated meeting that the padre had barely managed to keep from coming to blows, it was agreed they would petition the government for aid."

I know you’ve been busy trying to keep your father’s business afloat, economy being what it is, and I figured the last thing you needed was me distracting you. But I wanted to let you know you were right. I never should have enlisted. I mean, it’s not like I had a choice, but I should have taken the risk and dodged the draft. Maybe tried and get into a non-combat role. Too late now. Just more regrets to deal with.\n\nI’m stationed on the southern border. Mostly just trudging through dusty fields and what’s left of the jungle on patrols. It was interesting for a while, if exhausting. But it got monotonous. So, you can imagine my excitement when we get deployed to hunt down some intruders in our lands. The higher ups don’t want any repeats of the Southern Raids. Anyone even suspected of connection to logging companies or such are to be detained.\n\nWe fucked up, Maria. The orders came when we were halfway through apprehending them. Me and a couple of the others hesitated and requested confirmation, but the others acted. They weren’t loggers, or poachers, or anything like that. They were refugees. At least I think so. I tried reading some of the effects they had on them, but I couldn’t stomach it.\n\nYou probably hate me for what I did to those people, but I ask only one thing of you: don’t let Pablo get drafted. I know you probably don’t want your kid brother in the army as it is, and have tried talking him out of it already. But it’s no place for someone like him.

  bolivar.44.t:0 "The Living Dead?"
  bolivar.44.d:0 "A strange rumor has been making its way throughout Medellin, something about evil spirits haunting the nearby woods. Ever since the Rojo Disaster of 2187, when the Achilles Family Farms went out of business, the countryside has been forced to rely on foreign imports for sustenance. However, due to our souring relations with the Andean Compact and Brazil’s recent instability, some cities have undergone minor famines. Militia groups had been organized during the summer to hunt down prey and forage for food in the adjacent forests. With the end of the hunting season in October, many have returned home and the patrols in the woods have been stretched thin.\n\nThus it is no surprise that myths arise - the hunters have been known to erect small shrines around the forests to local deities, and many carry trinkets that they believe to be imbued with supernatural properties. Among the pantheon of tall tales that these rural folk have come up with are spirits of the woods and rivers, lost temples in the jungles, complex daily rituals that correspond to different types of luck or misfortune, and stories of terrible beasts in the woods. The latter has attracted much attention from the rest of Bolivaria, as the myths are very colorful and inspire dread like no others. For example, two hunters have reported finding staircases in the woods, alone, completely disconnected from any perceivable man-made structure. Many other bands swear that a creature known as Mapinguari, a tall and hairy beast, lives in the woods. Yet others say that there is a hidden Yankee laboratory deep within the Ecuadorian jungles, where mad scientists practice witchcraft and worship the devil known as ‘Seee-Raashioon’ and turn captured citizens into flesh eating demons! While these stories are good for business and some companies have monetized them through movies and books, none except the last have been confirmed by government or academic officials. The last story is likely based on the Foundacion de Avance Bioquímico 4, one of our top-secret installations dedicated to the study of the human body and viruses. The facility itself is well hidden beneath the Earth and is only accessible via a false Brazil Nut tree. The staff includes 3 scientists and 8 lab assistants, along with 1 SystemMax Co. AI core. Communications with the facility have, however, been irregular and the last report is dated in March. It might be prudent to call them up and see if anything is wrong or if the rumors have some truth behind them…"

  bolivar.45.d:0 "TO: President León\nBY: Carlos Viernes\nDATE: November 10th 2204\n\nOn behalf of myself and the rest of the Foundacion de Avance Bioquímico 4, I, Doctor Viernes of the Quito Institute Of Polyscience, must issue my apologies. We admit to having experienced major technical difficulties in the past several months and have avoided contact until we were sure that the situation was stable and all hostile entities contained. There is no need to send in reinforcements and I believe that we can resume our projects in peace. Let me explain:\n\nOn September 2nd 2204, S. Miguel isolated a strange compound from a piece of ore that the AutoExcavator had dug up in [REDACTED]. The compound contained living cells on the exterior which we began analyzing as part of Operation Jackhammer (see screen 3). The first two rounds of testing were simulated through the Aggregator but yielded very few findings. The next step was experimentation on live animals (two squirrels and a chimpanzee) who were injected with a mixture of the compound and some Class X5 adjustments. Both squirrels died within two minutes, while the chimpanzee survived a day and then suddenly expired, having shown no preceding signs of deterioration or illness. It should be noted that the animal exemplified unnatural vigor in its final day and consumed triple its usual meal.\n\nWe had intended to acquire human test subjects, but our pens were empty after Project Roulette. One of the staff proposed to raid a nearby farming hamlet with the drone fleet, and the operation was scheduled for the 4th of October. Unfortunately, before we could initiate the operation, S. Miguel was involved in an accident with the strange substance and it entered his body. The man ceased to be himself and turned feral, attacking Sm. Ana with his bare hands and inflicting a bite wound on her neck. Within two hours, the entire facility was under lockdown and the remaining scientists, including myself, locked ourselves within the command chamber. S. Miguel and 6 other infected scientists, now closer to beasts than humans, were able to access the elevator and exited the facility. We immediately armed ourselves and initiated AI Drone Targeting programming to help us in our pursuits.\n\nThe subsequent days were spent hunting down the turned beasts in the jungle, but we only lost one scientist. A group of local hunters lent us their services in exchange for provisions and all but three of the beasts were exterminated. The process was quite simple actually, as the hostiles had difficulty running and often stumbled over rocks. The remaining beasts were found near the barnhouse of a local hamlet, where they had starved to death. The outbreak, which we have codenamed [REDACTED], has been successfully contained. One of the scientists claims the situation eerily resembles some Yankee film he saw many years back, but given that its, well, a Yankee film, it must have been fictional."

  bolivar.46.d:0 "The movie industry had never really recovered from the Great Mistake. All the big studios had been hit hard by the economic chaos, either closing down or being absorbed into larger conglomerates like ARC. Where once had been a smorgasbord of multi-billion dollar blockbusters, there was now a comparatively small annual selection of smaller - often more amateur - productions. But even that limited flow had become a trickle trying to pass Bolivaria’s old censorship laws. The new laws, however, were not quite as restrictive.\n\nFor the first time ever, public domain films of American origin - hastily issued with AI-translated redubs - became approved for distribution. The first adopter was Ciudad de la Luz, an independent holotheater in Bogota. They were not driven by any grand ideals for doing so - they were simply desperate for some new content outside the usual roster of propaganda productions and state-approved classics. The films were timeslot fodder for people to stare at when they came into the air-conditioned holotheater to escape the heat. The management never could have expected the response.\n\nA local veterans association was the first to kick up a fuss, announcing a boycott of the establishment for supporting ‘American propaganda’. A nationalist club soon engaged in a sit-in protest until the police ordered them outside, where the demonstration quickly fizzled out as a heatwave struck the city. Even so, the holotheater became the talk of the country from the sudden attention, the focal point of the debate whether American movies should be banned once more.\n\nThe response from moviegoers? To many, the American origins were easy to overlook. Some of the plots were noticeably jingoistic or surprisingly pro-materialist, but there were some gems in there, especially those dating back to the Golden Days. Characters walked along beaches and city streets long since lost to the seas, their fictional lives untouched by the changing climate outside the studio. The plotlines didn’t even hint at the unrest that would snowball into the Great Mistake. It was a window into a long-lost age, free from the crises that had laid the world low.\n\nPerhaps that was the appeal. Simpler stories, from simpler times. Up on the screen, characters fought and loved and intrigued and joked, just as people had done across the ages. Only to them, they were mercifully disconnected from the new reality. The one that moviegoers begrudgingly returned to when the credits rolled."

  bolivar.47.d:0 "Bolivaria hadn’t been the most restrictive nation, but it had been one nonetheless. Ubiquitous military readiness had naturally demanded many sacrifices. Where resources were to be allocated, the military had enjoyed primacy. Where sociocultural matters arose, national security had been the foremost consideration. The lives of entire generations had been dictated by the threat of invasion, from the cradle to the grave. No longer did that have to be the case.\n\nFrom cleaning robots to virtual reality headsets, goods once deemed too frivolous to manufacture now lined shelves. So too were universities no longer limited to fields with military and essential civic applications, with newly-minted courses for business and the humanities quickly filling up with students young and old. The latest round of architectural graduates entered a construction industry where they could actually consider designs that didn’t boil down to glorified bunkers. There were enough of them already, especially with the air raid drills being dialled back in frequency. With each passing day, such drills came to be viewed less as a necessity and more of an annoyance to complain about to one’s bunker-mates. Conversation would quickly turn to other news and gossip, of which there was no shortage. But it was the prospect of returning to democracy - and all that entailed - that truly dominated discussions across the country.\n\n Such things might have been taken for granted in other parts of the world, but to the people of Bolivaria it was a momentous shift in national spirit. Big changes were coming. With each passing day, it resembled an overgrown fortress less and less. Wariness of America remained, as did questions about humanity’s shaken civilization on a battered planet. But for once, it felt like change was possible."

I don’t need to scan anything else? \n\nJose shook his head. ‘No, Abuela, you’re all set. Just tap the candidate you want to vote for.’\n\nAbuela smiled, looking over the various candidates listed before her, each smiling right back from their photographs. ‘You know, once upon a time only the officers and the politicians could vote. The same sort of people who were on the ballot! Might as well have not had any voting to begin with.’\n\n‘Good thing they changed it. I think it’s time we all got a say, even if it’s just locally.’\n\nAbuela hummed in response. ‘Perhaps. Things were different in those days. We all lived with the possibility of American invasion hanging over us. Even our neighbors were suspect at times. I don’t miss that part. But it all felt… purposeful. We all knew our duty to Bolivaria, and we carried it out. I truly hope we don’t lose sight of that.’\n\n‘We won’t, Abuela,’ Jose replied. ‘Things will be different, yes. But this is about what’s best for Bolivaria. The way forward isn’t as a hermit kingdom.’\n\n‘As long as we don’t weaken ourselves,’ Abuela said, tapping on one of the liberal candidates followed by the confirmation prompt. ‘Okay,  I think that’s it. Do I need to do anything else?\n\n‘Nope!’ Jose replied, smile widening. ‘Congratulations, Abuela! You’ve voted in your first election!’\n\nThe joy practically radiated from Abuela’s face. She wasn’t a young woman, and she’d seen much in her time. Most of it for the worst. The chaos of the revolution. The everpresent paranoia of American invasion. The slow but steady deterioration of the natural world. But that day was one for celebration."
  bolivar.48.a:0 "And, perhaps, hope that Bolivaria had better days ahead."
  bolivar.49.t:0 "A Tentative Lesson"
  bolivar.49.d:0 "Alejandra’s bravery failed her the second she positioned herself behind the lectern. It was a big class. The seats were all full, forcing several students to sit on the floor of the lecture hall. Then again, considering the room was bordering on disrepair and not that large a space to begin with, that spoke more of a strained facilities budget than a genuine interest in her story.\n\n‘Good afternoon!’ she said, putting on a smile. ‘Thank you for having me here. But yes, as Professor Garcia was saying, I’m going to speak with you all about the American invasion of Venezuela shortly before the Great Mistake. Much of the overall history I’m sure you’ve already covered in this unit, but I’m here to offer a more personalized account. You see… my great-great-grandfather was an American serviceman.’\n\nAlejandra paused after speaking the words. They were something she’d never uttered in public. And with good reason - more than one of her ancestors had been outed for having American blood in them, ending up ostracized or even forced to relocate. And they were the lucky ones. She took a sip of water to hide her unease, and buy time to survey the room. There were a few raised eyebrows. Perhaps a scowl or two. But most looked as indifferent or distracted as they had been long before she stepped before them. That boded well, in a way.\n\n‘Private Isaac McAvoy was his name,’ she continued, tapping a button to bring up her slideshow. Isaac - a tanned young man clad in his formal fatigues - smiled down from the projector screen. ‘He joined the military not out of patriotism, or any desire to seize oil supplies, but simple desperation. It offered him a way to pay off his educational debts and afford healthcare. Even a steady paycheck was strongly appealing in those days, with the rise of automation and disruption of essentially all industries from climate change. His was quite a common story long before the invasion.’\n\nAs she began to dive into Isaac’s actual involvement in the invasion - mostly serving as a rearguard protecting oil assets that had already been seized - Alejandra kept a close eye on the audience’s reaction. Indifference still reigned supreme, even if a few students were clearly not happy to be reminded of the American invasion. Especially the older ones. But others looked genuinely interested. Most were taking notes diligently, regardless of their apparent feelings.\n\n‘Of course, we all know how things turned out,’ Alejandra said, clicking to a slide depicting old satellite imagery that had managed to capture the first nuclear explosions on the Indian Subcontinent. ‘The Pakistani-Indian War went nuclear, ash filled the skies, and the Great Mistake began in earnest. The United States was caught completely unprepared, and its government faltered at every turn. For the forces deployed to old Venezuela, most were simply left behind. Some tried to return home, some continued to fight, while others - including Isaac - simply gave up. They lived as hermits in the hills, or tried to integrate into what was left of Venezuelan society in the Dark Days. Many Americans were killed in reprisals, but Isaac was fortunate enough to find a family willing to take him in.’\n\nThat was her favorite part of the story. Isaac - far from home in a world falling apart - managing to find a new life for himself. As chaotic as the world had been, he’d found safety, purpose, and ultimately love. In a way, it wasn’t hard to see history repeating. The world stood on a precipice, perhaps even more than it had during the Great Mistake. And yet, Bolivaria stood renewed and ready to face the future. There were still old wounds that needed healing - the disdain on the faces of some of the students attested to that - but she liked to think Isaac would have been proud of the country he’d come to love."
  bolivar.49.a:0 "Now, let’s talk about the woman that Isaac would one day propose to…’"
  bolivar.50.t:0 "Operating Costs"
  bolivar.50.d:0 "The Chief Financial Officer had obviously put a lot of effort into his presentation. The Chief Executive Officer would have done the same if his job had depended on it, just as the CFO’s currently did.\n\n‘We do have some good news,’ the CFO said, clicking his presentation to a graph that was anything but promising. ‘The government is prepared to let us complete our standing contracts. Provided we can deliver on those, we should be able to stave off a major decline in profit. But it’ll be tight, and moving forward the government will also be considering additional competitors for contracts instead of our previous arrangement..’\n\nThe CEO nodded along gravely. The old government - or at least certain members of it - had once had a good thing going with the company. The company would receive lucrative contracts and generous subsidies, and if their representatives in the government just so happened to be shareholders… what of it? Everyone was benefitting. The government got its infrastructure for its military installations, and the company made a good profit. What was there to complain about?\n\nBut along came democracy. Suddenly there was talk of ‘oversight’ and ‘transparency’, and a great reshuffling of government officials. Including those sympathetic to the company, who were shuffled right out of the proverbial deck. Contracts that had once been a champagne toast away from certainty would now have to be actually won via competition. At least in theory.\n\n‘We must have options,’ the Chief Operating Officer said. ‘We’re the largest infrastructure company in the country. Any others that have sprung up recently couldn’t possibly compete.’\n\nThe CFO snapped his fingers. ‘Precisely! A few are looking at merging, but we have a headstart in terms of size and reach. We also have a few inroads left into the government…’\n\n‘Just give me their names and positions,’ the CEO said. ‘I’ll ensure that they are amenable to our needs.’\n\nThe CFO handed him a report. ‘If I may, I have already outlined a proposal. There are certain inefficiencies in the current maintenance scheduling that may be excised to cut costs, and ensure we have a better chance of fulfilling our contracts. Not enough to pose a massive safety risk, but it would go against current government regulations.’\n\n‘Emphasis on ‘current’, I assume?’ the COO asked.\n\n‘We may be able to obtain some exemptions,’ the CFO replied. ‘Or have certain nonessential safety checks skipped periodically. As I said, nothing dangerous, but it should cut down on costs enough for us to safely see the contracts through to the end. Once we’re paid for those, the company’s position will be secure.’\n\nThere were a few grunts of assent from across the table, and the remainder of the presentation didn’t raise any red flags. The CEO half-listened on, flicking through the report as he ruminated. Liberalization had been such a paradoxical time. Full of opportunity, but full of pitfall. A time for hope, but a time for worry. A source of economic shock, but maybe - just maybe - profit."
  bolivar.50.a:0 "At least for those bold enough to seize it."
  bolivar.51.t:0 "Our Top Story"
  bolivar.51.d:0 "Theirs was not a large studio. Theirs was not a large show, after all. While the datalinks weren’t quite as accessible to content creators as the internet of old, they had a much lower barrier to entry than the few surviving television networks. Not that it had mattered in the old days, when the Bolivarian government’s grip on the datalinks was as tight as any other medium. But that was no longer the case, at least in theory.\n\n‘The numbers don’t lie,’ Zacarias said, as the Production Crew - the tongue-in-cheek name for both of the show’s staff - scurried around making last-minute equipment adjustments. ‘Viewership is pitiful. We’re not seeing any meaningful growth. Surprised it hasn’t declined.’\n\nOn the other end of the newsdesk, Luciana only shrugged in response. ‘Still more than we had before.’\n\n‘You mean literally nobody, because the government wouldn’t let us on air?’\n\n‘Yes,’ Luciana replied, utterly serious. ‘That is a massive improvement. They can’t silence us now.’\n\nZacarias rolled his eyes, adjusting his suit one last time. ‘Don’t give them ideas. Still… you can lead a horse to water, and all that. People can watch us, but that doesn’t mean they have to care. I think the numbers reflect that.’\n\n‘Some people do still care. More will. Okay, a lot of people are still apathetic right now. Maybe they don’t see the value in democratization. Maybe nothing about their lives have changed yet. But that just means we have to help educate them. We have to get them interested. Besides, success doesn’t always come right out of the gate, does it?’\n\nZacarias merely grumbled back in response. Once upon a time, he might have shared Luciana’s idealism. He’d spent years dreaming of the day democracy would come to Bolivaria, unwavering even as the old government shut down his old show for his statements on the matter. But what was he left with now that it was all being realized? An indifferent public unengaged with its newfound political power? A barely-existent platform to finally share his views without retribution? A nation that was moving agonizingly slowly from its isolation, if at all?\n\nIt was maddening. Truly maddening. Meeting Luciana and working alongside her had given him a spark of hope that his time had come. Their initial reception had been promising that he could finally help vanguard the democracy that Bolivaria’s stagnating politics sorely needed. The only thing worse than feeling like he’d failed was the idea that he never could have succeeded in the first place.\n\n‘I guess not,’ Zacarias replied. Before he could say any more, the Production Crew signaled that they were ready to start. Sighing, he put on his well-practiced - if utterly insincere - smile, staring down the lifeless eye of the camera. Its operator counted down on his fingers, and the show was on once more. At least for those who cared to listen.\n\n‘Good morning, Bolivaria!’ Luciana said. ‘I’m Luciana Moreno here with Zacarias Martinez, bringing you the latest news on our nation’s fledgling democracy. Tonight, we break down the latest figures on voter turnout, and how its growth lines up with professional projections…’"

  bolivar.52.t:0 "Military Report #10382 - Southwest Mutiny"
  bolivar.52.d:0 "The military police action ordered at the recommendation of Report #10376 has failed. Before our agents were in a position to arrest the rogue officers identified in the report, said officers rallied sympathetic elements of the local military garrison to raid their base’s armory. We believe that more than 200 soldiers have followed them into the mountains, where - according to documents left behind for us to find - they intend to launch an insurgency with the ultimate aim of restoring the old regime. They were able to acquire a large amount of military materiel to support this, including infantry weapons, explosives and supply crawlers.\n\nAdditional reports indicate several nearby farms have been targeted by these rebels, who took food, vehicles and other materials. At least three farmers and a local policemen were killed, with seven more injured with varying severity. Actual damage to the farms is minimal beyond loss of harvested crops, which is believed to be insufficient to sustain the rebel numbers for long. Further raids are likely, especially as any food the rebels took with them dwindles.\n\nAerial reconnaissance has identified their encampments, and we are continuing to monitor the situation. We do not believe that they have the numbers to carry out their goals, but they still pose a clear and present risk to the wellbeing of local civilian populations. The mountainous area gives them a tremendous advantage, offering many places to hide from aerial bombardment and ambush attacking forces. The loose organization may offer a chance of infiltration, as we have already caught and executed several soldiers attempting to defect to their ranks. However, with their establishment so recent, it is likely the group will be highly paranoid of additional soldiers attempting to join. They are also likely to strike again before covert action can bear fruit.\n\nGiven the politically sensitive and tactically ambiguous nature of the situation, the local military leadership and law enforcement requests advisement on how they are to proceed."

  bolivar.53.t:0 "I’ve Got a Brand New AutoTractor"
  bolivar.53.d:0 "It paid to have friends in the government.\n\nElonzo wasn’t hesitant to replace his old tractor. The original parts had long left production, leaving it a Frankenstein’s monster of jury-rigs. The tyres were more patch than original rubber. Even the engine was an old internal combustion model, running off a choice of hideously expensive gasoline or varyingly expensive ethanol. There wasn’t much difference in price when the crops were doing badly. Which, those days, was more common than not.\n\nBut fuel wasn’t a concern now. The new tractor - looking like the bastard lovechild of an actual tractor and the luxury cars of the Andean magazines - ran off a top-of-the-line battery that could not only be charged from the wind turbines peppering Elonzo’s fields, but from solar panels built into the roof of the cab. And what a cab it was! After decades of cramped legroom, the new cab felt like an apartment. Not that he even had to sit in the thing. Its onboard AI could drive it around the fields, coordinating its quartet of hovering drones to harvest the crops that its robotic arms couldn’t reach. Elonzo was already eagerly awaiting the day the AI fully mapped out the farm, allowing him to watch it work from the comfort of his porch, drink in hand.\n\n ‘I’m telling you, this is the future!’ he told his neighbours excitedly, slapping the side panel. He immediately withdrew his hand from the heated metal, which had been sitting out in the sun for hours. ‘Imagine the crop yields from these things! They even have sensors that monitor the crops as they’re being harvested, and can warn you about chemical imbalances or water shortages.’\n\nTeodoro from the next farm over didn’t even pretend to look impressed. ‘El, I could’ve told you my crops are damn near out of water. Same everywhere nowadays. I know this land better than some soulless computer.’\n\nHis wife Luisa didn’t look too excited, either. ‘Where did you get this thing, Elonzo? It must be worth a fortune.’\n\nElonzo rubbed the back of his neck. ‘Well… it’s complicated. The new foreign imports arrived last week, and a… associate of mine needed volunteers to test them out. So, I put my hand up, and got lucky.’\n\nIt was clear nobody was buying it. For a moment, he wondered if they might try to steal it. The parts alone would easily buy them a larger water allotment. Hastily, he added, ‘Of course, this thing should get the work done way quicker than my old tractor. If you ever need it for your farm, you need only ask.’\n\nTeodoro regarded him with momentary skepticism, but the look Luisa gave him dispelled it. ‘That’s very kind of you, El,’ Teodoro said. ‘Still… I don’t know what good it’ll do. Another bad year or two like this and we’re finished. Only thing going bad faster than the soil is the weather. Doubt that fancy machine of yours can help there.’\n\nElonzo shook his head slowly, not knowing what to say. His new toy had been a nice distraction from all that. The difficulties he’d been having with his own crops. The forecasts on the datalinks. The looks in the eyes of the other farmers when he saw them at the market. Perhaps the bleeding-edge technology would help. Perhaps it wouldn’t."

  bolivar.54.t:0 "Back to School"
  bolivar.54.d:0 "It was just as well the rationing on coffee had lifted. Marianela was on her fourth cup by midnight.\n\nThe previous days had been a whirlwind of directives, updates, redactions, un-redactions, and general alterations that left the new curriculum almost unrecognizable. That was to be expected, of course. The country’s education system faced the unenviable task of implementing the biggest change in the national syllabuses in more than a century. No longer was education intended to be a mere stepping-stone between childhood and national service, but it would now have to prepare children for life in a very different Bolivaria than their parents had known.\n\nMarianela leaned back from her terminal with a sigh. For the better part of fifty years she’d been teaching Bolviaria’s youngest generations. It had had its ups and downs, but she was starting to look back on those days fondly for their simplicity. Now it felt like the uncertainty gripping the country was leaking into its classrooms. That is, where there even were classrooms anymore. So much of it was delivered online now due to the superbugs. Every night, Marianela prayed that the network nodes would hold out. Just as she did that the changes coming to the country would present more of an opportunity to her young charges than a threat to their already embattled futures.\n\nShe reached for the coffee pot for one last refill, but realized it wasn’t going to help. Instead, she shut off her terminal and collapsed onto her bed. As she lay there in the cramped confines of her apartment, old conversations replayed in her head. Her students were aware of what the country was going through. They weren’t stupid. But they still had questions, naturally. Some of which had left her without a good answer. But they didn’t seem afraid. It was likely they had enough on their plate with the threat of ecological collapse or enemy invasion, even if the Americans were unlikely to live up to their boogeyman reputation. But perhaps they weren’t as prone to overthinking it as she was. Theirs would be a world very different to the one she’d grown up in. If nothing else, she could only do her best to prepare them for it."

Thus, over the decades, gunsmithing has become somewhat of a family art.\n\nThis needs to change. Domestic production is quite low, and some countries continue to reject automation in fear of angering existing gunsmiths, who are more necessary than ever in today’s boiling world. Fortunately, the wise Bolivarian government has come up with a compromise: instead of completely automating the gunsmithing trade, existing smiths will be able to collaborate in newly designed factories (instead of plying their trade in personal stores).
