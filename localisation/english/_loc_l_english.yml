    BE_BOOKMARK_NAME: "BEYOND EARTH /////////////////////////////////"
    BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The year was 2070. Tensions between two Asian powers, having reached a boiling point, spilled over all too quickly.\n\nInternational powers had no time to react and, before anyone knew it, a new Dark Age engulfed the world. The Golden Days were over.\n\nThe brief but deadly Pakistani-Indian War left an incredible footprint across the continent. Millions perished from famine, millions more were displaced. Soon the rest of the world felt the cold grip of ash. Economies collapsed. The satellites fell. The spirit of all nations was shaken.\n\nBut the Great Mistake did not end there. The lifestyle of modern societies, the exponential consumption of goods, the inability of people to look beyond tomorrow led to an even worse situation. The oceans swallowed entire cities. Societies enclosed on themselves, fighting wars of survival. The Earth, so close to globalization, fell far. The scars of bygone eons became visible once again. Hard times led to the development of new currents of thought, philosophies were forged to deal with the Great Mistake, with new technologies, with new problems.\n\nBut soon this era too will end. Civilizations across the world are awakening, one last time, to finish what they started, to bring balance to the world or to seek a second chance... Beyond Earth."

    CHI_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "China has for more than a century been a hegemonic power following the historical social, political and economic destabilization of its competitors for the position. And so it has been until recent years. Able to predict the oncoming environmental onslaught, the Chinese People's Party prepared for the Great Mistake far better than any other state on the Earth. This, however, was not the long-lasting victory it was predicted to be.\n\nAlthough Chinese hegemony in East Asia and beyond was strong, internal issues kept dragging the nations down. China was able to bounce back, at the cost of large-scale inequality, over-automation and widespread corruption. This confluence of circumstances has led to an effect of more and more radicalisation within the disenfranchised Chinese population.\n\nThe world's center can not hold."
    SOV_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Eurasia, despite its unfamiliar name, is the successor state to Russia. It was created approximately around the advent of the Great Mistake in order to deal with the issues that faced the Russian state at the time. Disproportionate minority rights, an overly powerful oligarchy and lack of representation within the state. This decision would send Eurasia on yet another course for disaster.\n\nAfter a failed invasion of Central Asia, the Eurasian Union broke. The old oligarchic families that ruled the old federation were still tasting sour grapes and flung the Union into civil war. Whilst the war has died down, the insurgencies continue. The Karelians wish to restore the oligarchic system, the Siberians wish to bring back systems from Russia's past, the Uralic AGS wish to seek power for themselves and the Vostoslavs seek to create their own state.\n\nThe Eurasians, however, seek to create the Slavic Federation, a proposed alliance between all of slavic Europe that'd be able to counter the superstates of China, Franco-Iberia and the EAF. This is of course, only a dream, but one that seems closer each and every day.\n\nA riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma."
    BHR_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "India, along with Pakistan, was one of the instigators of the Great Mistake, the nuclear conflict which they spawned catalyzed the issues of the Pre-Mistake world into the Great Mistake itself. Of course, as the epicenter of the Great Mistake, it's only natural that India be the most affected by it. Most of north India is a society trying to find its feet again, most of south India is impoverished and divided between warlords and Pakistan and Bangladesh are filled with destitution beyond human comprehension.\n\nThe most important man in this fractured India is one Raj Thakur, the modern Gandhi, the modern Vivekananda, the modern leader and prophet for a new India. Starting his career as president of the Indian successor state, his political thought soon slipped into popular thought, not as a political doctrine, but as a way of life. As the people yearned for more teachings from Thakur, he gave it to them, his political thought slowly morphing into a syncretic religious doctrine that spread across northern India almost as quickly as the radiation years before.\n\nBharat stands at a crossroads, the death of the prophet is imminent, his life being the only thing preventing India from collapsing into a battle royale. But even if he were to die, Bharat can make sure that he lives on.\n\nIndia has finished licking its wounds."
    FRA_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "It can be said, and it is said, that Franco-Iberia is the spiritual child of the former European Union. While its territorial claims seem to indicate that its goal is to dominate the continent once and for all, some of its leaders are still squabbling over how to approach it.\n\nOne of the country's most important components is the Mediterranean Sea, which is essential for the country's exports, with important trading partners such as Padania, Greece and even the Maghreb. Still, important emerging powers want to unseat Franco-Iberia from its position of economic hegemony, clashing head-on with the government's agenda."
    GER_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Germany acts as the spearhead of an important environmental movement under the acronym INTEGR, which is spreading throughout Europe, especially in neighboring countries such as Czechia and Poland.\n\nGermany's leaders use this political platform to achieve governance, differing slightly from each other in terms of objectives, but with major differences in methodology. INTEGR does not only focus on environmental issues, but also has positions on social and political issues, although this varies from directive to directive, and its popularity has exploded in recent years."
    BRA_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Brazil is a harsh military dictatorship, with its government and populace blaming all their misfortunes on the Andean Compact, their most direct neighbor, with the use of state propaganda.\n\nThe Andean Compact has on several occasions been accused of exploiting the continent, especially lithium, by moving the wealth out of it, impoverishing the rest of the countries and condemning them to hell. Brazil believes that only through a strong reaction can the tyranny of The Andean Compact be halted.\n\nSeeing as most of the little wealth and resources that Brazil has left has been invested in its military in anticipation of a potential war with the Compact, Brazil certainly has the capability of throwing the entire region of South America into needless conflict."
    TZN_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Originating in Tanzania, the East African Federation has spread enormously since its foundation. It was by no means easy, but the collective drive for a sovereign Africa emancipated from outside interests has been a goal since long before the Great Mistake.\n\nThe centralized vision of the continent has been challenged for several years by major powers such as the Congo, or even mega-corporations such as Morgan Industries.\n\nThe struggle continues, and much remains to be done for Africa to finally break free from its historical chains, and for the nation that will be born out of it to defend it for another hundred centuries."
    ARC_BE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Central is the authority that represents the North American Union internationally. Although the Union is seen from the outside as a country broken by multiple uprisings, Central tries to maintain its influence over the country.\n\nThe main competitors for influence in the Districts that make up the Union include not only Central, but also the mega-corporation that is A.R.C, also known as the American Reclamation Corporation.\n\nThis corporation began to serve the government by helping and preventing the population from natural disasters. Since then it has gained popularity, influence and profits unseen by any other American company."
