Continuing the prized legacy of popular government and the Social Contract, democracies are highly transparent, reducing corruption and backdoor deals.\n\nUnfourtunately, increased political participation, combined with mass media, contribute to a very polarized society, where passing even the simplest of bills is a long and complicated process.§!"

To salvage the situation, military and violent civilian groups took over certain countries, ruling with an iron fist. Although such governments claim to be a temporary measure, many exist for the sake of perpetuating an elite group.\n\nThe main aim of this form of government is to defend at all cost the way of life of the nation and preserve the national unity.§!"

Instead power is devolved to local councils consisting of all individuals of that community, who then are able to send representatives to higher councils for regional or national matters.

Ranging from the absense of civilization to failed anarchist experiments, from massive mobs to unorthodox governments, an unstable government has difficulties in everything.\n\nPassing laws is borderline impossible, corruption can be found in all aspects of society, and the state - or what remains of it - is usually unable to collect taxes or field proper armies.§!"

    #ENERGY DESC
    energy_desc:0 "§LEnergy resources are natural resources that can be used to generate energy for human activities. They are classified into two types: non-renewable, which will eventually be depleted, and renewable, which can be replenished naturally over time.\n\nNon-renewable resources include fossil fuels and nuclear energy, while renewable resources include solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and biomass energy.\n\nRenewable resources are considered more sustainable and environmentally friendly than non-renewable resources.§!"

    #POLYMERS DESC
    polymers_desc:0 "§LPolymers are large molecules made up of repeating units called monomers. They can be natural or synthetic and are used in a variety of applications, from plastics and fibers to adhesives and coatings.\n\nThe properties of polymers depend on the specific monomers used and the way they are arranged, making them a versatile and important class of materials.§!"

    #SUPERCONDUCTORS DESC
    superconductors_desc:0 "§LSuperconductors are materials that can conduct electricity with zero resistance and energy loss at very low temperatures. They are made of metals, alloys, or ceramics with unique electronic properties and have potential applications in various fields, such as medicine, transportation, and computing.\n\nThe primary challenge in using superconductors is maintaining low temperatures, but recent developments have led to the creation of high-temperature superconductors, which could make practical applications more feasible.§!"

    #SUPERALLOYS DESC
    superalloys_desc:0 "§LSuperalloys are high-performance metal alloys that can withstand extreme temperatures and environments. They are made of nickel, cobalt, or iron, along with other elements, and have unique properties such as high mechanical strength and resistance to thermal and chemical degradation.\n\nSuperalloys are used in critical applications where reliability and long service life are essential, such as in gas turbines, jet engines, and nuclear reactors. They also have potential applications in emerging technologies like hypersonic flight and space travel.§!"

    electronics_desc:0 "§LElectronic components are physical devices that make up an electronic system or device. They control the flow of electricity and include a wide range of components, such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. Each component has a specific function, and they are used in a variety of electronic devices, from calculators to computers.\n\nElectronic components come in different shapes, sizes, and materials and are connected to each other to create a circuit that performs specific functions.§!"
