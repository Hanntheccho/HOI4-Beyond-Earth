 randomevent.1.t:0 "Migrants Settle Down"
 randomevent.1.d:0 "The Great Mistake displaced many people. Floods, famines, and war all caused entire minorities to pack up and move. Governments were usually incapable of stopping this internal and external migration, and have only restored order in the countryside in the middle of the 22nd Century. These migrants (and the term is quite generous, as some are nothing more than marauding gangs grown into entire populations, while others are stragglers or refugees from nearby wars) often travel the country depending on the seasons, taking up refuge in welcoming settlements or around lakes and rivers.\n\nIn recent weeks, an uptrend of migrating tribes settling down has been observed. It appears that some peripheral farmland has been reclaimed and the migrants have settled down there. The place is bountiful in livestock and harvest, so much so that the tribes have been selling extra produce to the cities. Their new settlement will be properly integrated into the nation next week, with some representatives being sent over to our capital."
 randomevent.1.a:0 "This land is your land… This land is our land."
 randomevent.2.t:0 "Petition For Research Hospital"
 randomevent.2.d:0 "A group of scientists have recently filed a petition for the chartering of a new research hospital. The institution has been often criticized for unethical experiments on animals behind closed doors, with some allegations going as far as to blame research hospitals for the disappearances of certain individuals. However, few can deny that the research hospital system hasn't helped with great advancements in health and genetic research. To further their cause, the scientists have also pledged considerable portions of their personal wealth towards the hospital charter, and have promised full transparency in regards to test results."
 randomevent.2.a:0 "Deny them, we will not sink to such levels."
 randomevent.2.b:0 "Accept the proposal, then demand additional fees."
 randomevent.2.c:0 "Accept the proposal and send a government and media attaché to oversee all experiments."
 randomevent.3.t:0 "Settled Border Dispute"
 randomevent.3.d:0 "Due to the waves of migrating tribes and post-Great Mistake confusions, the borders of our nation, both on land, sea, air, and orbit, are contested by rival powers. Some peripheral settlements are still ruled by petty warlords and gangs. Thus far, we have lacked the manpower to exert complete influence over all parts of the country, and have had to rely on a complex web of diplomatic deals and intrigue with other political entities. Fortunately, today marks a different occasion. Our diplomats, after many days of hard work, have finally settled a major boundary dispute with another organization. While the border change is too trivial to have any material impact on the entire nation, it serves as a symbol of the peace to come in the near future. Many believe that this will lead to a new era of closer cooperation with others."
 randomevent.3.a:0 "Here's a toast for peace!"
 randomevent.4.t:0 "Exceptional Month!"
 randomevent.4.d:0 "The economists are reporting unprecedented growth over the course of the past 40 days. Whether the product of perfectly timed government interventions or ambitious investing operations, the economy has grown considerably. Unemployment levels are down across the board, and welfare programs previously thought immaterial have finally shown a profit. Highway bandit raids are down too, and the payrolls have finally been able to arrive at the distant mines and lumberies. Small businesses are flourishing while museums and theaters are reopening for the first time in many years."
 randomevent.4.a:0 "And the stock market report?"
 randomevent.5.t:0 "Deflation!"
 randomevent.5.d:0 "Analysts believe that we have entered into a short period of currency deflation. While this occasion may have caused mixed feelings before the Great Mistake, as deflation was often associated with lower consumer spending and a decrease in prices, post-Mistake society has come to value deflation as a momentary reprieve. Due to the crumbling nature of the economy, as well as constant bandit raids and online bank hackings, our nation's currency has become very difficult to trace and casual traders constitute only a small portion of the economy. Deflation, while still damaging to long-term growth and sometimes an indicator of low investments, allows our already stretched budget to spread across more underfunded sectors."
 randomevent.5.a:0 "The balloon falls back to the Earth..."
 randomevent.6.t:0 "Recolonization Petition"
 randomevent.6.d:0 "After the Great Mistake, our nation made many efforts to recolonize regions lost to the waves and ash. However, by this point, almost all salvageable areas have already been recolonized. That being said, every so often, explorers find a green glen or abandoned farmland ripe for resettling. In some exceptional cases, these places even contain pre-Mistake infrastructure that can be repurposed to accommodate instant repopulation. Such villages often operate by exporting foodstuffs or raw materials in exchange for medical supplies and weapons. Bigger settlements have populations in the near millions, while many others barely reach a hundred folk.\n\nIt is then an unfortunate fact of life that these new settlements often come under attack by bandits or enemy raids, which has disincentivized urban dwellers from migrating there. Recolonization operations are usually conducted by specialized government or corporate entities, who loan farming equipment and bodyguards for the colonists. However, due to the dangers of such actions, and the geopolitical and social implications of moving many peoples around, recolonization efforts in excess of a hundred thousand require special government permits to settle in unowned properties. A group of enterprising settlers, mostly consisting of youth, have petitioned their local representatives for being granted an official recolonization charter."
 randomevent.6.a:0 "Deny the petition on the basis of insurmountable danger to the prospecting settlers."
 randomevent.6.b:0 "Let the colonists settle where they please."
 randomevent.7.t:0 "Extinct Species Revived!"
 randomevent.7.d:0 "In the years following the Great Mistake, and to a lesser extent in those preceding it, it was not uncommon for rare animal species to go extinct on a daily basis. Indeed, there are assumed to have been innumerable unique breeds that had gone the way of the Dodo without ever being discovered by humans. However, the last century experienced the largest damage done to the biodiversity of Earth. During their collapse, some countries tried to save certain species. However, with their resources stretched thin, many governments adopted a policy of preserving a creature's DNA and other critical information for future cloning.\n\nRecently, a group of scientists at one of our most respected universities have managed to revive an animal thought lost to time. The genetic integrity is not perfect, however, and the breed had to be synthesized from other DNA structures. It is unlikely that the reintroduced species will be able to survive in the wild, nor is it possible for it to reach its pre-Mistake population levels. However, the accomplishment itself is what matters, and the event serves as yet another reminder of humanity's ingenuity."
 randomevent.7.a:0 "No, sir, you may not purchase it for dinner."
 randomevent.8.t:0 "Human Trafficking Operation Uncovered"
 randomevent.8.d:0 "Due to the impoverished state of many villages, rural mayors have experienced dramatic salary cuts in recent years. In some instances, this has become a positive thing, as leaders strive for office regardless of monetary compensation. In more disturbing cases, however, mayors feel the need to pay themselves. This is often accomplished through human trafficking. Police reports have summarized that the practice is usually sponsored by local governments, who fund bandits or send out settlement militias to kidnap travelers and people who live alone.\n\nThe target is often kidnapped during the night, either pulled into a passing unmarked van, or drugged through their home's ventilation system and extracted by paid thugs. They are then brought to black markets, where they are sold based on bodily proportions, gender, skills, or personal relations. Due to the pervasiveness of this practice, law enforcement personnel have often experienced difficulty uncovering such operations. Fortunately, just last week, an extensive human trafficking ring was uncovered after a long but successful raid on their compound in the countryside. The head sponsor, a local mayor, now awaits trial while the surviving victims have been freed."
 randomevent.8.a:0 "Let us hope this will dissuade other bandits."
 randomevent.9.t:0 "Festival Procession"
 randomevent.9.d:0 "In these difficult times, many citizens have turned to festivals to celebrate recent accomplishments, national pride, or to respect cultural customs. Modern festivals range in extent and size from settlement to settlement. Rural celebrations often take the form of Spring and harvest festivals, usually celebrated around large farmsteads and lakes. On the other hand, urban festivals are grand processions, featuring thousands of workers and machines. Holidays such as national days, leaders' days, and religious festivities are commonly celebrated nationwide, while smaller villages tend to have their own celebrations. Everyone is welcome to attend, and businesses often capitalize on the opportunity by setting up discounted merchants."
 randomevent.9.a:0 "Time to be happy!"
 randomevent.10.t:0 "VR Competition Concludes"
 randomevent.10.d:0 "Times are undoubtedly dark, but in the past century and a half of toil and struggle, there has almost always been something for the general population to numb their pain and escape reality: video games, and watching others play them. Recently, a large Virtual Reality gaming tournament took place, the event broadcast across every state internet that would accept it. Famous competitors donned their headsets and their full-body trackers and competed in a series of platforming, teamwork and shooting games in a grand spectacle that drew the attention of hundreds of thousands. When the competition concluded and the winners were praised, the typical drum of life returned, but those who observed left with memories of celebration, excitement and adrenaline-pumping tension."
 randomevent.10.a:0 "Congratulations to the winners!"
