 randomevent.1.t:0 "Migrants Settle Down"
 randomevent.1.d:0 "The Great Mistake displaced many people. Floods, famines, and war all caused entire minorities to pack up and move. Governments were usually incapable of stopping this internal and external migration, and have only restored order in the countryside in the middle of the 22nd Century. These migrants (and the term is quite generous, as some are nothing more than marauding gangs grown into entire populations, while others are stragglers or refugees from nearby wars) often travel the country depending on the seasons, taking up refuge in welcoming settlements or around lakes and rivers.\n\nIn recent weeks, an uptrend of migrating tribes settling down has been observed. It appears that some peripheral farmland has been reclaimed and the migrants have settled down there. The place is bountiful in livestock and harvest, so much so that the tribes have been selling extra produce to the cities. Their new settlement will be properly integrated into the nation next week, with some representatives being sent over to our capital."
 randomevent.1.a:0 "This land is your land... This land is our land."
 randomevent.2.t:0 "Petition For Research Hospital"
 randomevent.2.d:0 "A group of scientists have recently filed a petition for the chartering of a new research hospital. The institution has been often criticized for unethical experiments on animals behind closed doors, with some allegations going as far as to blame research hospitals for the disappearances of certain individuals. However, few can deny that the research hospital system hasn't helped with great advancements in health and genetic research. To further their cause, the scientists have also pledged considerable portions of their personal wealth towards the hospital charter, and have promised full transparency in regards to test results."
 randomevent.2.a:0 "Deny them, we will not sink to such levels."
 randomevent.2.b:0 "Accept the proposal, then demand additional fees."
 randomevent.2.c:0 "Accept the proposal and send a government and media attaché to oversee all experiments."
 randomevent.3.t:0 "Settled Border Dispute"
 randomevent.3.d:0 "Due to the waves of migrating tribes and post-Great Mistake confusions, the borders of our nation, both on land, sea, air, and orbit, are contested by rival powers. Some peripheral settlements are still ruled by petty warlords and gangs. Thus far, we have lacked the manpower to exert complete influence over all parts of the country, and have had to rely on a complex web of diplomatic deals and intrigue with other political entities. Fortunately, today marks a different occasion. Our diplomats, after many days of hard work, have finally settled a major boundary dispute with another organization. While the border change is too trivial to have any material impact on the entire nation, it serves as a symbol of the peace to come in the near future. Many believe that this will lead to a new era of closer cooperation with others."
 randomevent.3.a:0 "Here's a toast for peace!"
 randomevent.4.t:0 "Exceptional Month!"
 randomevent.4.d:0 "The economists are reporting unprecedented growth over the course of the past 40 days. Whether the product of perfectly timed government interventions or ambitious investing operations, the economy has grown considerably. Unemployment levels are down across the board, and welfare programs previously thought immaterial have finally shown a profit. Highway bandit raids are down too, and the payrolls have finally been able to arrive at the distant mines and lumberies. Small businesses are flourishing while museums and theaters are reopening for the first time in many years."
 randomevent.4.a:0 "And the stock market report?"
 randomevent.5.t:0 "Deflation!"
 randomevent.5.d:0 "Analysts believe that we have entered into a short period of currency deflation. While this occasion may have caused mixed feelings before the Great Mistake, as deflation was often associated with lower consumer spending and a decrease in prices, post-Mistake society has come to value deflation as a momentary reprieve. Due to the crumbling nature of the economy, as well as constant bandit raids and online bank hackings, our nation's currency has become very difficult to trace and casual traders constitute only a small portion of the economy. Deflation, while still damaging to long-term growth and sometimes an indicator of low investments, allows our already stretched budget to spread across more underfunded sectors."
 randomevent.5.a:0 "The balloon falls back to the Earth..."
 randomevent.6.t:0 "Recolonization Petition"
 randomevent.6.d:0 "After the Great Mistake, our nation made many efforts to recolonize regions lost to the waves and ash. However, by this point, almost all salvageable areas have already been recolonized. That being said, every so often, explorers find a green glen or abandoned farmland ripe for resettling. In some exceptional cases, these places even contain pre-Mistake infrastructure that can be repurposed to accommodate instant repopulation. Such villages often operate by exporting foodstuffs or raw materials in exchange for medical supplies and weapons. Bigger settlements have populations in the near millions, while many others barely reach a hundred folk.\n\nIt is then an unfortunate fact of life that these new settlements often come under attack by bandits or enemy raids, which has disincentivized urban dwellers from migrating there. Recolonization operations are usually conducted by specialized government or corporate entities, who loan farming equipment and bodyguards for the colonists. However, due to the dangers of such actions, and the geopolitical and social implications of moving many peoples around, recolonization efforts in excess of a hundred thousand require special government permits to settle in unowned properties. A group of enterprising settlers, mostly consisting of youth, have petitioned their local representatives for being granted an official recolonization charter."
 randomevent.6.a:0 "Deny the petition on the basis of insurmountable danger to the prospecting settlers."
 randomevent.6.b:0 "Let the colonists settle where they please."
 randomevent.7.t:0 "Extinct Species Revived!"
 randomevent.7.d:0 "In the years following the Great Mistake, and to a lesser extent in those preceding it, it was not uncommon for rare animal species to go extinct on a daily basis. Indeed, there are assumed to have been innumerable unique breeds that had gone the way of the Dodo without ever being discovered by humans. However, the last century experienced the largest damage done to the biodiversity of Earth. During their collapse, some countries tried to save certain species. However, with their resources stretched thin, many governments adopted a policy of preserving a creature's DNA and other critical information for future cloning.\n\nRecently, a group of scientists at one of our most respected universities have managed to revive an animal thought lost to time. The genetic integrity is not perfect, however, and the breed had to be synthesized from other DNA structures. It is unlikely that the reintroduced species will be able to survive in the wild, nor is it possible for it to reach its pre-Mistake population levels. However, the accomplishment itself is what matters, and the event serves as yet another reminder of humanity's ingenuity."
 randomevent.7.a:0 "No, sir, you may not purchase it for dinner."
 randomevent.8.t:0 "Human Trafficking Operation Uncovered"
 randomevent.8.d:0 "Due to the impoverished state of many villages, rural mayors have experienced dramatic salary cuts in recent years. In some instances, this has become a positive thing, as leaders strive for office regardless of monetary compensation. In more disturbing cases, however, mayors feel the need to pay themselves. This is often accomplished through human trafficking. Police reports have summarized that the practice is usually sponsored by local governments, who fund bandits or send out settlement militias to kidnap travelers and people who live alone.\n\nThe target is often kidnapped during the night, either pulled into a passing unmarked van, or drugged through their home's ventilation system and extracted by paid thugs. They are then brought to black markets, where they are sold based on bodily proportions, gender, skills, or personal relations. Due to the pervasiveness of this practice, law enforcement personnel have often experienced difficulty uncovering such operations. Fortunately, just last week, an extensive human trafficking ring was uncovered after a long but successful raid on their compound in the countryside. The head sponsor, a local mayor, now awaits trial while the surviving victims have been freed."
 randomevent.8.a:0 "Let us hope this will dissuade other bandits."
 randomevent.9.t:0 "Festival Procession"
 randomevent.9.d:0 "In these difficult times, many citizens have turned to festivals to celebrate recent accomplishments, national pride, or to respect cultural customs. Modern festivals range in extent and size from settlement to settlement. Rural celebrations often take the form of Spring and harvest festivals, usually celebrated around large farmsteads and lakes. On the other hand, urban festivals are grand processions, featuring thousands of workers and machines. Holidays such as national days, leaders' days, and religious festivities are commonly celebrated nationwide, while smaller villages tend to have their own celebrations. Everyone is welcome to attend, and businesses often capitalize on the opportunity by setting up discounted merchants."
 randomevent.9.a:0 "Time to be happy!"
 randomevent.10.t:0 "VR Competition Concludes"
 randomevent.10.d:0 "Times are undoubtedly dark, but in the past century and a half of toil and struggle, there has almost always been something for the general population to numb their pain and escape reality: video games, and watching others play them. Recently, a large Virtual Reality gaming tournament took place, the event broadcast across every state internet that would accept it. Famous competitors donned their headsets and their full-body trackers and competed in a series of platforming, teamwork and shooting games in a grand spectacle that drew the attention of hundreds of thousands. When the competition concluded and the winners were praised, the typical drum of life returned, but those who observed left with memories of celebration, excitement and adrenaline-pumping tension."
 randomevent.10.a:0 "Congratulations to the winners!"
 randomevent.11.t:0 "Augment Malfunction"
 randomevent.11.d:0 "An unpleasant setback for the military came today during an incident on one of our bases. With a field test of some of our new infantry augmentation, one of our soldiers was allegedly tampering with the settings of their augmentations while inside the suit – something strictly prohibited by the user's manual. The augment suit reportedly 'sprung' closed around the user, crushing their body in a manner that most witnesses still refuse to talk about. Needless to say, these prototype variants have been pulled from service, and despite their foolishness, our soldier has been dismissed with full honors, though with several broken limbs and extensive brain damage."
 randomevent.11.a:0 "It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe."
 randomevent.12.t:0 "Government VR Scandal"
 randomevent.12.d:0 "Something of an awkward matter has come up. One of our government ministers has recently been exposed for one of their private pastimes – apparently partaking in rather...unorthodox practices in online VR chat rooms and committing unsavory acts within them. The minister claims to have been blackmailed over the information and insists to us, and to the ravenous press, that the acts were an entirely private matter that brought no harm to anyone. The accusations can't be denied now – the videos all over the data link network have seen to that. All that remains is the question of what to do with this... unconventional individual."
 randomevent.12.a:0 "They must be dismissed for the sake of our image."
 randomevent.12.b:0 "They can stay, their work is too important."
 randomevent.13.t:0 "Serial Killer Rampant!"
 randomevent.13.d:0 "In recent weeks, a disturbing series of murders has left the nation locking their doors and readying to defend themselves. What is believed to be a serial murderer has been stalking the nation, killing seemingly random targets in a fashion far too brutal to publish on the evening news. The killer is thought to be using public transport to put as much distance between their previous target and the next, and the modus operandi seems to be the only linking factor. Rumors abound of the killer's true origin, from a rogue Artificial Intelligence to an online stalker, using the internet to mark their victims before killing them. The police's inability to apprehend the murderer has not resulted in a positive reception from the public, and several letters, true or false, have been sent in claiming to be from the killer themselves, mocking the authorities and our government. The police investigation is in full swing, but no results have emerged."
 randomevent.13.a:0 "They'd better catch that lunatic soon."
 randomevent.14.t:0 "DDoS Attacks"
 randomevent.14.d:0 "The 'Distributed denial of service' attack is considered by most to be an antiquated method of cyber-attacking. But unfortunately, just as a gun does not mean a spear is less lethal, modern defense methods do not mean a DDoS attack of great force cannot overpower us; such is what is currently ongoing across our nation. Likely a domestic terrorist, a foreign power or simply just a bored student is deploying a high strength DDoS attack across important government websites and servers, and the impact is somewhat slowing down our daily tasks. While we are certain these attacks will end once the perpetrator is inevitably tracked down, we may have to put up with the ongoing cyber-harassment."
 randomevent.14.a:0 "Damn those college kids."
 randomevent.15.t:0 "Dissident Propaganda"
 randomevent.15.d:0 "A series of propaganda pieces by parties opposed to the current government have recently been released. Already too viral for any kind of suppression actions, the films and images depicting the less ideal aspects of our rule have been widely circulated both across local internet, and physically with posters and holographic projections in public areas. The content of these films ranges from debatable half-truths to unpleasant facts we had assumed the public was unaware of. The damage to the status quo has already been done, and so there is little left to do but to attempt to remove this unpatriotic fervor."
 randomevent.15.a:0 "Fake news, all of it."
 randomevent.16.t:0 "Training Accident"
 randomevent.16.d:0 "A serious incident occurred today during a live-fire training exercise. During a team building task, some of our squads were fighting their way through a mock facility of basic robotic 'hostiles', when an abrupt power outage blacked out the training arena. Due to a communications breakdown, the troops inside the simulation believed the blackout to be a part of the exercise and continued their advancement, but soon became separated in the dark. Before contact could be re-established with the trainees, there had been several incidents of friendly fire and multiple casualties. An investigation into the cause of the blackout and of the competence of the training instructor is underway, and all live-fire exercises have been temporarily halted."
 randomevent.16.a:0 "Who on Earth was commanding them!?"
 randomevent.17.t:0 "K0m3t Sighted"
 randomevent.17.d:0 "Over the last two decades, a notorious hacker by the name of 'K0m3t', simplified to 'Komet', has been terrorizing seemingly random piece of internet and digital infrastructure. It began in 2183 with a streak of bot accounts spamming the phrase 'nyoom' into frequented websites, and replacing all user input with the same phrase. This streak of hooliganism and digital vandalism continued until 2190, when several national banks across the world were attacked and funds withdrawn into similar bot accounts, the phrase 'K0m3t thx u 4 ur donation' inserted onto every system. Ever since, Komet has been branded a terrorist by numerous international organizations and governments, but all attempts to track and apprehend the individual have failed. It seems he has struck again, however, as several pieces of digital infrastructure have found themselves hijacked, reset or otherwise vandalized with the terrorist's signature methods and calling cards. As always, our systems and operators were too slow to catch him, and his digital trace has vanished into the aether once again. We may never know his methods, or his reason for why he targets what he does, but his reign of terror has yet to come to a close."
 randomevent.17.a:0 "Catch him- Oh, damn!"
 randomevent.18.t:0 "Nationwide Heat Wave"
 randomevent.18.d:0 "For a few days now, an extreme heat wave has rattled our nation. The high temperatures have made it difficult for many to go out and commute to their daily activities, and for some, it has even caused physical pain. Power grids are doing their best to manage frequent outages from increased air conditioning use. Many are in local hospitals trying to recover from heat stroke and dehydration, some of them having lost their battle and passing away. For those in more rural areas, farmers have reported crops wilting, some reporting poor harvests. Ever since global warming began to speed up in the 21st century, heat waves have grown to become much more intense, and causing a lot more damage than before. Many hope that no fires will spring up and cause more damage, although most people have accepted deep down that they will very likely appear."
 randomevent.18.a:0 "Who touched the thermostat?"
 randomevent.19.t:0 "Rampant Wildfires"
 randomevent.19.d:0 "As a result of the intense summer heat, reports of wildfires have become frequent across the country. Civilians in dry areas have noticed columns of smoke rising from the distance. Evacuations of affected areas are now underway, though some are unable to make it out, unfortunately perishing. Search and rescue efforts have begun as well, and all available resources are being used to combat the spreading fires. Nearby communities have also supported affected regions via donations and sending firefighters to combat the crisis. Countless lives have fallen victims to the hellish infernos, while many survivors remain burnt so severely that they have been forced into intensive medical care. Buildings and infrastructure alike have been burnt down, as Earth punishes our nation for its role in the Great Mistake."
 randomevent.19.a:0 "Through the Fire and the Flames"
 randomevent.20.t:0 "Tornado Outbreak"
 randomevent.20.d:0 "Tornados have swept the nation this past week as several have been reported to have formed across the country. These powerful twisters have ripped apart buildings and infrastructure, and have taken countless lives. They ripped through our populated areas very quickly, leaving behind nothing but a dirt trail scattered with debris, as well as people who have fallen victim. It will be difficult for the government to deliver aid, as roads have been damaged and littered with rubble, and the same goes to airports, with some of the smaller ones being completely wiped off the map. The people can only rely on themselves to climb out of their once thriving towns, at least for now. Thankfully, such instances are not as common as before, although it is still something people must be aware of."
