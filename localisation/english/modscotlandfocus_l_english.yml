 SCO_sea_never_sleeps:0 "The Sea Never Sleeps"
 SCO_sea_never_sleeps_desc:0 "The mountains stand firm as the tides turn far below, rising and falling. This is how it's been since the dawn of time. However, now the sea comes in sweeping lives, towns, and entire cities out to sea, never to be seen again. Though other people cry and weep before they give in to the sea, we do not, and will not. As always we fight, for once, not with sword and rifle but with shovel and crane. Even now, we lead a war against the very sea itself, reclaiming from its depths what it has stolen. Massive pipes pump water away, as with steel and concrete we build vast walls to reclaim land and keep the sea out."
 SCO_the_arks_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the project's divine namesake, we have built great cities upon the sea that have taken so much. Each city is an ark, to preserve humanity, an industrial monument of economy and skill. Each one is a hub of human traffic, as everyone seeks a place on the arks. Demand outweighs supply as usual during a disaster."
 SCO_the_nsa_desc:0 "The North Sea Alliance is a great idea, one that could bear powerful fruit. For now it is an alliance crumbling from within as old rivalries resurface and delusions of grandeur seep into the politics. This is exemplified by the two most powerful members, Scotland and England. England shudders and wails in pain as it crumbles from within, vultures fighting over her heart. Scotland strives to make a new future separate from England, but fears the chaos of the South and English stubbornness. Though if these troubles can be overcome, it shall grow in strength as new member states join the pact, fulfilling its namesake as it claims dominion over the North Sea."

 ENG_political_violence:0 "Political Violence"
 ENG_political_violence_desc:0 "After many years of populist politics and political instability, English society is on the brink of civil war. The military is markedly differentiated into three major groups: those who support the more conservative side, those who support the continental green movement and finally those who believe in the current government.\n\nThe situation is also being fuelled by the hidden intervention of Franco-Iberia and Germany, which, in an effort to extend their influence, have caused the opposition's commitment to power to be carried out at all costs.\n\nIt is not the first time that England has found itself in such a situation, but the latest European leaders and their ambition has pushed the country to the limit this time."

We will coordinate with the British government by supporting them with political campaigns and special brigades.\n\nWhen the time comes, we must move fast, blocking foreign intervention, coordinating with our Irish neighbours, moving through the sea as if it were air.\n\nIf we do this correctly and quickly, the war will be easy, otherwise we could enter into a stalemate with the other sides."

 the_nsa_decisions:0 "The NSA"
 the_nsa_decisions_desc:0 "The NSA was born as an attempt to fight the sea, our natural enemy since even before the Great Mistake.\n\nScotland, along with Ireland and the Netherlands, founded the North Sea Union in order to coordinate efforts and technology, developing never before seen techniques that gave the countries an edge in the fight against the rising tide.\n\nAfter several decades the inevitable happened, in 2144 heavy squalls and rains along with a raging tide wiped the Netherlands off the map. The Nordic countries such as Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Denmark and even Sweden accepted Dutch refugees and provided the defunct country with the necessary resources to save as much as possible, both materially and personally. The Great Flood of '44 killed thousands of people and wiped out an entire country.\n\nWhat was left of the Netherlands was annexed by Germany by mutual agreement, with Germany offering to rebuild what was left of the country and building housing estates to accommodate the Dutch population.\n\nThe global impact of the event led the Nordic countries (except Germany) to join the North Sea Union, renamed the North Sea Alliance.\n\nThe Second Great Flood of '56 wiped out Denmark. The technology developed by the Alliance made it possible to stay ahead of the situation long enough to get the vulnerable population out of the country. Once again, Germany stepped forward to annex the area. This time the agreements dragged on, and no agreement was ever fulfilled. Jutland simply became German administration. The area is still claimed by Alliance members.\n\nThe history of the NSA is based on survival through coordination, and it is inevitable that greater coordination and common projects will be pursued in order to deal with any crisis. It is time to unify efforts in a robust manner."
