 UKR_eurasian_dominance:0 "Eurasian Economic Dominance"
 UKR_eurasian_dominance_desc:0 "Following Eurasia's occupation of Eastern Ukraine in the late 21st century, our nation has been effectively shackled by Eurasian enterprises. Russian businessmen own our factories, plantations, even minor army units. It is imperative that we stabilize this relationship... or find someone else to stand beside."
 #UKR_reduced_freefactories:0 "§O-30%§! Free Factory Speed"
 UKR_eurasian_dominance_red:0 "§R-0.5 Industrial Power§! Daily Gain\n§RUntil we throw off the shackle of Eurasia, our economy will remain dependent on the Union State's whims.§!"
 UKR_all_slavs:0 "All The Slavs"
 UKR_all_slavs_desc:0 "Ukraine is home to many Slavic groups. Besides the Ukranians and Russians, former Belorussians, Vostaslavs, Poles, and international citizens all seek refuge besides the Danube. Unfortunately, sometimes diversity breeds chaos, and these groups all struggle to live in peace with one another."
 UKR_all_slavs_red:0 "§RUntil we deal with the many Slavic groups within our country, there is no way to prevent sabotage and ethnic clashes.§!"
 UKR_country_life_support:0 "A Country On Life Support"
 UKR_country_life_support_desc:0 "The Ukrainian nation has been the victim of floods, invasions, and political strife. A century of humiliation later, and Kiev's grip on the country teeters on the brink of collapse. Foreign actors, such as our Eurasian overlords, megacorporations, and even supposed friends in Germany have all taken a piece of the pie that is Ukraine."
