 TRE_absence_of_civilization_desc:0 "The land once known as the East Coast is dead and buried under the sea. Following the Great Mistake, the entire populations of New York, Boston, and other ancient metropoli fled for the Midwest. As expected, the unstable Federal government was unable to deal with mass migration and buckled in the 2nd American Civil War. Famine set in. Families turned into gangs and friends killed friends just for a slice of meat. So it continues to this day. The East Coast is in complete anarchy. The only authority comes from ARC's enforcers, who have fortified checkpoints and refugee camps, bringing some semblance of order to the wastes."

 TRE_the_last_earthlings_desc:0 "Were a person to travel back to the 21st century and question its inhabitants as to the projected situation of the United Nations two hundred years forward, few would have guessed that the once global organization would be hanging on to dear life in some backwater. But this is indeed the case, and Earth's finest (as they like to call themselves) have been stranded in New England for centuries. Children have heard stories of wars and the apocalypse from their soldier-parents, grown into adults and died while still wearing the UN insignia.\n\nThe dream of a united Earth lives on, fueled by loss and regret. Perhaps the Coasts have nothing left to lose, or perhaps, in some rusted half-sunk home is a new generation, born into poverty but kept alive by stories of a wonderful world that awaits just beyond the horizon..."

 #POLITICS_ARC_DISTRICT_3_DESC:0 "The ARC Oversight Board is a ruling council composed of 20 members, 18 of whom are direct corporate representatives from ARC itself. Assigned to the District with the stated goal of maintaining order and reviving civilization, the Board's members have elected to build up their strength by going on vacations and purchasing the newest augmentations. ARC would do something about this insubordination, but is too preoccupied with global concerns. The Board controls the only organized military force in the District, the 68th and 45th ARC Peacekeeping Divisions.\n\nWhile opposed at nearly every opportunity by local interest groups and the United Nations), the Oversight Board's power is near total. The Board commands full respect in the cities by controlling their water flow and ration intakes. While dissent is theoretically meant to be dealt with swiftly, the Board has been accused of neglecting its duties and allowing the raiders to grow out of control."

His education culminated in degrees in philosophy and medicine from an ARC University, after which he returned to the cities to work as a surgeon for several years, training in thoracic surgery. His experience with the horrors of post-Mistake anarchy took him into public service.\n\nServed as member of research team investigating genes that encode proteins aiding with DNA repair, ARC HQ, District 3. Later appointed Assistant Director, North America ARC Health Division. Achieved full rank as Head Physician before unexpectedly quitting all ARC organizations and returning to UN camps. Progressed speedily through UN service and married in 2189 to another physician. Achieved Commissioner of Welfare rank in 2192, before becoming Secretary General in 2198."
