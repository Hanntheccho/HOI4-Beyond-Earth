 ONE_land_of_the_free_desc:0 "The provinces once known as "California" are fried. Just like its East Coast counterpart, the land is heavily flooded and has a bloody history of anarchy. The few who remain live their lives as raiders, pillaging long-abandoned homes and farms in a never-ending search for food. Scars from meltdowns and chemical warfare still plague the air."

 ONE_central_aid_high_desc:0 "This District is receiving supplies and developmental aid from Central. While these resources are but scraps off an already tiny plate, the survivors are ready to do anything to get some fresh meat or more ammo."

 POLITICS_SURVIVOR_CLIQUES_DESC:0 "District 1 has no governing body or civilization. There are no urban cities, American suburbs, or even sustainable farms. The biggest settlement is a small village of about five thousand near the coast, which trades with pirates for food. The rest of the District's inhabitants are forced to either hunt increasingly scarce prey, vegetation, or, in more extreme instances, each other. As the District is incapable of producing its own supplies, much less its own weapons, it relies on occasional Central shipments.\n\nThus, as time has passed, Central has tightened its grip on the District. All ammunition inflow is possible solely through Central's approval. This new power has therefore made many successful attempts at playing the local tribes against one another. The cliques are taking over one another, completely oblivious to their position on Central's chopping block. However, immediate reconstruction of social order in District 1 is impossible. The land is ruined by poisonous gases released by warlords over the decades. Irradiated ruins still dot the plains and hills. And the survivors keep fighting..."
 POLITICS_CENTRAL_ADMINISTRATION_ONE_DESC:0 "Some semblance of order has finally been brought to District 1. Central has set up a net of garrisoned settlements along the frontier, allowing for a much wider range of supplies to be delivered. The poor inhabitants of the District have already taken to praising their saviors and the survivor cliques of yesteryear are almost washed away. Civilization is returning to District 1. But under whose boot?"
 POLITICS_COLONEL_CORAZON_SANTIAGO_DESC:0 "Corazon Santiago was born in District 1 in 2159 to a family of pirates from Puerto Rico. When she was still quite young, her family fled to Central, where she was orphaned during the riots of 2165. Despite her age, she took her younger siblings and joined a survivalist street gang known as the Jade Falcons. She somehow survived the experience, although when she later reappeared in District 1, her siblings had vanished. Santiago never speaks of them, and their fate is unknown.\n\nIn old California, Santiago served as part of a settlement security force (the Red Panthers) and then joined the City Guard of Wayward Harbor, one of the largest villages in the District. She distinguished herself as a battalion commander when the city was attacked by a warlord. This service won her much fame, setting her on a path to found the Spartanists, a selective order of survivalists who stake out a living in old California by destroying bandit hideouts and collecting protection tribute from settlements.\n\nExcellent discipline, physical agility and ability to thrive in any environment led to her being regarded as an exceptional leader. Santiago has a powerful will and practices intense self-discipline. She is adaptable, aggressive, proud, and extremely tenacious. Her personality is one of icy self-control over volcanic rage, the result of her tormented childhood. She will stop at nothing to ensure her own survival and that of her followers. In the end, she has every intention of making herself the absolute ruler of old America."
