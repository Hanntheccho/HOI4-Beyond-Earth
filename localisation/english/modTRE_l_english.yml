  TRE_absence_of_civilization_desc:0 "The land once known as the East Coast is dead and buried under the sea. Following the Great Mistake, the entire populations of New York, Boston, and other ancient metropoli fled for the Midwest. As expected, the unstable Federal government was unable to deal with mass migration and buckled in the 2nd American Civil War. Famine set in. Families turned into gangs and friends killed friends just for a slice of meat. So it continues to this day. The East Coast is in complete anarchy. The only authority comes from ARC's enforcers, who have fortified checkpoints and refugee camps, bringing some semblance of order to the wastes."

  TRE_the_last_earthlings_desc:0 "Were a person to travel back to the 21st century and question its inhabitants as to the projected situation of the United Nations two hundred years forward, few would have guessed that the once global organization would be hanging on to dear life in some backwater. But this is indeed the case, and Earth's finest (as they like to call themselves) have been stranded in New England for centuries. Children have heard stories of wars and the apocalypse from their soldier-parents, grown into adults and died while still wearing the UN insignia.\n\nThe dream of a united Earth lives on, fueled by loss and regret. Perhaps the Coasts have nothing left to lose, or perhaps, in some rusted half-sunk home is a new generation, born into poverty but kept alive by stories of a wonderful world that awaits just beyond the horizon..."

  TRE_arc_oversight_board:0 "Oversight Board" #ARC Oversight
  TRE_arc_oversight_board_desc:0 "The ARC Oversight Board is a ruling council composed of 20 members, 18 of whom are direct corporate representatives from ARC itself. Assigned to the District with the stated goal of maintaining order and reviving civilization, the Board's members have elected to build up their strength by going on vacations and purchasing the newest augmentations. ARC would do something about this insubordination, but is too preoccupied with global concerns. The Board controls the only organized military force in the District, the 68th and 45th ARC Peacekeeping Divisions.\n\nWhile opposed at nearly every opportunity by local interest groups and the United Nations), the Oversight Board's power is near total. The Board commands full respect in the cities by controlling their water flow and ration intakes. While dissent is theoretically meant to be dealt with swiftly, the Board has been accused of neglecting its duties and allowing the raiders to grow out of control."

 #Events
  tre_event.1.t: "Dragons"
  tre_event.1.d: "Winter was difficult in old Pennsylvania. Apart from the ever-present threat of bandit attacks, villages had to make do with limited harvests. The lack of modern harvesters, combined with gang warfare and regular livestock raids, meant that no agriculture was possible beyond the sustenance level. As villagers were forced to spend most of the year farming, superstitions and legends returned to the popular imagination. Common practices included the planting of seeds under specific stars, the making of totems to ward off raiders and evil spirits, and preset seating arrangements.\n\nDifferent villages had different beliefs, but a common trait found in all was an intense fear of the unknown. Villagers often avoided untrodden trails, lest they lead to a faceless monster in the woods, or a mind horror along the abandoned shores.\n\nIn one village (which happened to be situated near a small mountain), the inhabitants were convinced that a dragon lived in the nearby cave. When ARC engineers arrived to repair a barn, they were told tales of a fire-breathing monster stealing cattle and young women during the dead of night. The local militia, armed with pitchforks and pre-war hunting rifles, once organized a hunt to find and slay the beast. Few returned, but those who did retold a haunting scene: the dragon had scales made of steel, it incinerated people with its breath, and had giant red eyes. Since the incident, the locals have voted to abandon their settlement and move in with their neighbors a few miles over."
