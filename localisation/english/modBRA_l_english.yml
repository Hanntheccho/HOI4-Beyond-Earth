  BRA_manuel_velho:0 "Manuel Velho"
  BRA_manuel_velho_desc:0 "General Manuel Branco Velho had always stood apart from the rest of Brazil's military elite. Where most commissioned officers were the sons of generals and oligarchs, Velho enjoyed no such privilege as the fourth son of a Cuiabá handyman. Like many in the favelas, Velho and his brothers left for the army at a young age in pursuit of a better life.\n\nDuring the Cerrado War, Velho lost all but one of his brothers in the war against the guerillas, yet gained a reputation as a model soldier who never flinched in the face of the enemy. His heroic actions during Operation Navalha caught the attention of his commanding officers, who then acted as his patrons during his rise to the Brazilian High Command during the 2170's.\n\nAn avowed Brazilian nationalist, General Velho was the driving force behind the Coup of 2198 that overthrew President Frederico Watanabe for his connections to the Andean Compact. Declaring a state of emergency soon after, he then focused on restoring the prominence of the Brazilian Armed Forces in preparation for the eventual war with the Compact, claiming them to be both the main threat Brazilian sovereignty and the main obstacle to Brazilian prosperity.\n\nWhile his critics paint Velho as yet another opportunistic dictator, he maintains that he has always been a man who has stopped at nothing in service of his fatherland. Everything that General Velho has done has been in the name of reasserting Brazil's status as a global power by any means necessary."

Led by the stern and experienced war hero Rejinaldo de Alencar, the new provisional military government is well-positioned to reclaim what Velho lost in his arrogance: stable, sane, and functional government. However, General de Alencar must also fight against accusations of being just another tyrant, and prove that the Novo Tenentes' rhetoric of democracy and justice is more than just empty words."

  LAM_lucio_ximenes_desc:0 "It was once said, that the first person who will live 150 years has already been born. There are more than a few who think that Ximenes will hold that title. Born in Brazil during the Great Mistake, Ximenes grew up seeing the consequences of humanity's destruction of the environment first hand. Once he came of age, he took a job in academia, travelling across South America, learning of the continent's rich culture and history. He had hoped that through this scholarship, the solution for mankind's failure could be found. He was wrong. Years of travel and research made him realise that Brazil needed more than philosophers to save the Amazon. That was when he met Eloa Alvarez.\n\nAlvarez grew fond of such an educated man, and brought Ximenes into their "Survivalists" a group of insurgents who sought to preserve the Amazon through action not words. For a time, Ximenes went along with this group and happily helped in their mission. But as the years went on, he began to see Alvarez not as a liberator, but a semi-fascist autocrat. With a heart heavy from the many crimes he had committed, Ximenes deserted the group, taking many like minded followers with him.\n\nXimenes spent the next few decades forming his own Survivalist militia, revealing himself as a gentle man with a kind heart. Many flocked to his side, viewing Ximenes as the best chance for Brazil to save itself. Both culturally and ecologically. Emphasised by his reluctance to use the under handed tactic used by other factions. But now, at over a century old, and a chance to realise his dream for a green Brazil here, it is feared he will not live to see it. The young man that once led entire platoons of soldiers and guerrillas can now only walk with the assistance of a cane. Even the advanced medicine and technology of this era give him a few decades of life at the most. With the Grim Reaper fast approaching, Ximenes plans to use his skills as much as he can. So that when he finally does depart from this world, it will be a better place than when he entered it."

Even for them her practices are brutal, and this brutality enforces her will over theirs. Survivalists are loyal, but that loyalty is only to power. A sign of weakness, and the warriors may leave to stronger rulers still- or deem themselves stronger instead. Survivalists are both a source of strength, and what tests it. Often, signs of mercy may be a weakness in the eyes of those who find mercy an alien thing, and there will be time for mercy once the work is done.\n\nHer history is usually kept private- she sees no reason to share it- but it is generally understood she grew up among the lower classes along the northern outskirts of Brazil, the tumultuous border regions of her country. Raiders, bandits, and survivalists often raided her home, making each day a question of life and death. Her father was the only notable figure in her life, an old soldier who fought in a forgotten war. Despite his efforts, his beliefs contrasted with what Eloa saw- and she saw violence.\n\nViolence breeds violence, and the womb of war bred something far worse than petty thieves and lost warriors robbing families- it bore Alvarez, and at her command was all the horrors her army could muster.\n\nShe was borne by the sword, and was forced to live by it, and now she must ensure no other weapon may pose a threat to her people, her people of many blades."

Ultimately, however, Velho's downfall was brought about by his own piggy arrogance. After the tyrant's failed invasion of the Compact, the rightful President Watanabe has finally made his glorious return. With Andean support and volunteers from around the world, the forces of the old republic have returned to put down upstarts, tyrants, and radicals, and to restore freedom and democracy to Brazil and right the wrongs of the past years."

  brazil.1.d:0 "All across Brasilia, feeds automatically tuned in to livestream from the capital. Everything from ancient televisions to urban mesh networks abruptly shifted into a brief blur of static, clearing into a shot of President Manuel Branco Velho before a podium, flanked by rows of generals on either side. His face, as always, was stern. Weathered, with lines that spoke of a long career as a soldier rather than a politician. President Velho himself spoke with a similar, self-evident bluntness.\n\n"People of Brasilia. I come before you today, a proud man. Proud not of my own accomplishments, but of yours! Yes, yours! In these past two years we have endured much as a nation. All of us have sacrificed something for the good of our people, for our families, our neighbors, our fatherland. Yet we no longer have to sacrifice our pride as a nation! No longer must we sacrifice our liberties for the sake of foreign greed! No longer must we sacrifice our lives for the sake of scheming politicians! What we have sacrificed, brothers and sisters, we have sacrificed in the name of Brazil and Brazil alone! Yes! For this, I am proud of you!"\n\n"I swear to you that soon, yes, soon all of our sacrifices shall bear fruit! No longer shall our children fear of foreign aggression! No longer must we fear starvation as our neighbors grow fat from their plunder! No longer, I tell you! No longer shall Brasilia suffer from fear and doubt, for we are building a brighter future together, my brothers and sisters! Our forces are strong, yes, yet our resolve is even stronger! Be proud, people of Brasilia, for it is you who will lead us to victory!""
  brazil.1.a:0 "Já não! Avante para a vitória!"
  brazil.2.t:0 "The State of the Armed Forces"
  brazil.2.d:0 "As one would expect, the Brazilian Armed Forces are at the heart of General Velho's regime. With most political functions "temporarily" suspended by the state of emergency, power is largely concentrated in the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces in what is effectively a military junta headed by General Velho's nationalist clique. Though the junta still enjoys a degree of popular support, owing to widespread anti-Andean sentiment, the fact remains that Brazil is a state governed by the strength of its army.\n\nAt present, Brazil currently maintains the largest military in the western hemisphere. Yet while quantity is not an issue, quality most certainly is. The vast majority of Brazillian soldiers are conscripts, undertrained and underequipped. In many regiments, the closest thing to trained soldiers are thugs from the favelas and bandits from the country. While the Compact's armed forces are small compared to Brazil's, they are considerably more professionalized and have access to objectively superior weapons.\n\nYet General Velho remains confident in the capabilities of the Brazilian military. "Wars are not won by fancy toys or lazy politicians," the general declared in his address to the Joint Staff, "but by superior tactics and strategic brilliance. Where the Compact was founded by refugees safe in their mountain villas, our republic was saved by the bravery of our armed forces. Unlike the Andes, Brazil is no stranger to war. They will learn this for themselves soon enough!""
  brazil.2.a:0 "An army of donkeys, led by lions..."
  brazil.3.t:0 "The State of the Economy"
  brazil.3.d:0 "Hit particularly hard by the Great Mistake, the economy of Brazil quite literally vanished overnight. Brazil's largest industrial centers, vast tracts of arable land, and the cornucopia of the Amazon were all utterly destroyed. From the military junta's attempt at instituting a command economy to President Watanabe's disastrous privatization campaigns, every endeavor to restore Brazil's industrial might has seemingly been doomed to fail.\n\nToday, only the cities of Brasília, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and Curitiba remain viable industrial centers. The rest of the country has largely reverted to agrarianism out of necessity, leaving little room for further economic growth or developments without proper capital. What few urban centers remain could more accurately be described as city-sized favelas, crowded by the impoverished descendents of coastal refugees, interrupted by islands of the neighborhood-compounds of the rich and powerful.\n\nMobilizing such a haggard economy is a difficult task, yet General Velho has made surprising progress over the past two years. Financed by assets seized from pro-Watanabe oligarchs in the aftermath of the '98 coup, the military-industrial complex has managed to expand significantly in preparation for war against the Compact. While the economy has seen steady growth as a result, the fact remains that the Joint Staff is paying for such expansion with "borrowed" capital. Many international observers, largely critics of the Velho regime, believe this unprecedented period of unsustainable growth may yield disastrous consequences for the Brazilian economy.\n\nBy contrast, the mood in Brasilia itself is very optimistic. Just as General Velho himself is confident in a Brazilian victory against the Andes, so too is he confident that the territory to be gained as a result will more than make up for the costs of mobilization, making no secrets of his designs on the lithium mines of the Andes. While some may argue that this a double-edged sword, where failure to seize the wealth of the Andes will result in a potential financial crisis, General Velho certainly is not entertaining the idea of failure."

  brazil.4.t:0 "The State of Brazil"
  brazil.4.d:0 "A cursory glance through the newsfeeds of Brazil show a nation ready, willing, and able to march against the Andean menace. A smiling field hand in the verdant fields of a Bahian plantation states with pride how her beloved filho just made sergeant in the marine corps. Military engineers in Rio Branco complete construction of an anti-drone installation, surrounded by an applauding crowd of grateful civilians. A spontaneous rally in support of General Velho's Andean crusade erupts in Cuiaba, gathering around a smiling holograph of the man himself, waving flags and proudly saluting the savior of Brazil.\n\nYet a closer glance at the actual streets of Brazil tells a very different tale. One of an exhausted, weary nation. The patriotic fervor that accompanied Velho's march on Brasilia has long since dissipated, replaced by a dejected ennui. Most Brazilians fear the depredations of gangsters from the favelas or bandits from the hills, not soldiers from the Andes. More than anything however, the common folk fear being unable to provide for their families, trapped as they are in a perpetual cycle of poverty and violence.\n\nGeneral Velho is not a man blinded by his own propaganda. Indeed, he is wholly aware of the grim reality many Brazilians face. He endured them himself, after all, in the slums of Cuiaba. Yet from his lofty position in Brasilia, he sees that Brazil itself remains trapped in the very same cycle of hardship, unable to escape. Not without help.\n\nNot without one last victory for Brazil."

When the trials of the Great Mistake came, there was panic and confusion, yet the pendulum kept swinging all the same.\n\nLike the rest of the globe, Brazil lost much to the rising tide. The cities of Rio de Janiero, Salvador da Bahia, and Fortaleza were swept away in the Deluge, displacing millions of Brazilian citizens. The Amazon Rainforest, or what little of it remained as the sea flooded the basin, suffered a near total ecological collapse thanks to devastating wildfires and rampant deforestation. The Republic of Brazil quickly veered towards collapse as banditry, neo-coronelism, and insurrectionists tore the nation apart at the seams.\n\nAs the civilian government faltered, the Brazilian Armed Forces seized control of the republic in a relatively bloodless coup and established a military junta. Centered in the city of Brasilia, the military quickly mobilized what few resources remained and embarked on a long campaign against the warlords and rogue states that had risen up during the Great Mistake. After a decade of non-stop civil war, the military junta managed to reunify the nation under its repressive, yet stabilizing rule."

The Brasilia Junta transformed into the Seventh Brazilian Republic.\n\nFor a short while, things were looking bright for Brazil... yet still the pendulum swung.\n\nBrasil's postwar economic recovery bottlenecked. While core industries were shakily approaching pre-Mistake levels, the state's dirigisme left them woefully outdated. Urban development came to a slow halt, and soon the infamous favelas of Brasilia's past made their unwelcome return throughout the country. Then came the disastrous "Campanha Espacial"."

  brazil.10.t:0 "Brazil - Part Three"
  brazil.10.d:0 "In 2196, President Frederico Campos Watanabe announced the "Campanha Espacial", the "Space Campaign". Working with investors from the Andean Compact, Brazil would transform the Amazon Sea region into South America's first major spaceport, an undertaking President Watanabe claimed would both reinvigorate and modernize the nation's economy. Instead, the Space Campaign quickly became a political disaster for the Watanabe administration, one that would lead to the end of the Seventh Republic.\n\nMegastructure projects were constantly stalled by natural disasters, logistical snafus, labor strikes, and investment pullouts that left Brazil footing the bill for much of the endeavor. As the Space Campaign dragged on, the situation in Brazil continued to worsen. Many voices had begun to accuse President Watanabe of putting the interests of the Andean elite above that of his own people, the loudest among them coming from the Brazilian Armed Forces. Fiercely nationalistic, the Brazilian general staff quickly began to view the Watanabe administration as a threat to national security. Tensions between the civilian government and the armed forces continued to simmer until 2198, when rumors of an encroaching budget cut rippled through the army's ranks. The pot boiled over. The pendulum completed its swing.\n\nGeneral Manuel Branco Velho and his clique of nationalist officers marched on the city of Brasilia, deposing President Watanabe and reestablishing military rule. Claiming that Brazil was under the imminent threat of an Andean invasion, General Velho announced a state of emergency until Brazil was truly secure from threats both internal and external.\n\nFor the past two years, General Velho and the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces have maintained the state of emergency, overseeing the gradual mobilization of the sluggish Brazilian economy. Foreign industries have been nationalized under military control. Conscription has been ramped up with the goal of bringing as many Brazilians out of the favelas and into the barracks as possible. For the past two years, Brazil has held her breath in anticipation for the final conflict. It has come time to decide whether General Velho shall lead her to greatness, or if the pendulum shall swing back sooner than expected..."

The official statement blamed high levels of rioting around the embassy for the evacuation, but the most likely explanation is the preparation for war. Andean units have been observed training on the border, and drone reconnaissance has confirmed the construction of miles of bunkers along the Andes. Bolivarian units in the North have taken this opportunity to show their strength as well, and many were seen wielding Andean weapons. Our own armies, while significantly larger in size, have been underperforming in drills. Several generals have spoken against training in fear of provoking an early Andean invasion, but based on our informants in the West, this is unlikely to be the case."

The diplomats took a private dropship and have safely returned to Cuzco, bringing with them vital information on the state of Brazil:\n\nBrazil is falling apart. The current regime has enacted voluntary conscription, but due to military benefits and high poverty levels, many are forced into joining. Likewise, the country’s economy is bloated from an oversized military and is ready to crumble at any moment. Exports have nearly ceased to exist and the service sector has reached a legendary bottom, with many specialists fleeing abroad, mostly due to political prosecution. Protests and riots are rampant and the regime’s control over periphery villages and farms is dubious. In the event of a war, Brazil will likely collapse in 3 months’ time, as survivalist groups in the North have already taken up arms against the nation.\n\nAdditionally, our units have coincided the embassy’s evacuation with increased drills. We were also able to get Bolivarian units to assist us, thereby forcing Brazil to spread their soldiers thin. Our generals believe that enemy units lack discipline and have no means of breaking through our mountain defenses."

He would have to start all over again.\n\n‘It’s nothing, ma.’ The door to his room slowly opened and an elderly woman walked in. Miguel, trying to escape her judging gaze, shifted his attention to a dripping pipe above. The water fell nearby, drop by drop.\n\n‘How many times do I have to tell you, Miguel, the summer is almost over! It’ll be your final year soon.

Dancers in wild dresses came out from both ends of the stage, followed by bards and then the main actors. The rehearsal continued for hours. Although Miguel had already seen this play before, it never ceased to amaze him. He took the pipe and stared in wonder at the scene below:\n\nA man, played by a local star, was having an affair with an old love. His wife, whom he had married for monetary gain, knew, and was trying to win over his genuine affection. Meanwhile, his ex-wife was married to a struggling businessman, who was completely oblivious to the whole thing.\n\nIn the end, despite all of the arguments and persuasions, the play ended in tragedy: the businessman suddenly became rich and his wife broke off her affair with the her ex-husband, who had, just the night before, finalized his divorce with his wife, who had given up on him and instead befriended a former friend from abroad. Left with neither money nor love, the man becomes a highwayman and dies offstage.\n\nDuring all this time, Miguel could not help but marvel at the acting, the production, but most importantly, the story.

A part of him also wanted to check on his mother, in case she had forgotten to take her medicine again. However, enticed by his companion, he agreed to sneak around the streets in search of adventure. Brasilia, like many other cities, had a sizeable population of scavengers. These were not the brutish, full-time raiders of the North, but rather simple folk hoping to find something of value to sell.\n\nPassing by dark alleys, Miguel glimpsed a light at the end of one. He tapped the girl’s shoulder and pointed. She smiled and they entered. The alley was a long one, extending by boarded up windows and unemptied dumpsters. Turning on their flashlights, the pair saw it: the shell of a military vehicle, probably from the coup decades ago. Remnants of past civil wars and revolutions still littered the favelas, but most had been picked clean of their insides long ago. The girl jumped on the vehicle and peeked inside the lidless hatch:\n\n‘Yeah, I see it too.’ she yelled and jumped in. Miguel followed her. The interior of the vehicle was cramped and rusted. The seat was taken, the loading mechanism was removed, but there was still a dim light coming from the Assist Core. Miguel wondered how it retained any power, but his mind quickly shifted to the future – cores like this fetched a high price down in the Lacheta. Maybe he could even afford new medicine for his mother, or a gift for-\n\n-but the girl said something about going to find a mechanic and jumped out.

He tightened his grip over his heavy flashlight and, shaking, tried to calm himself. This was not the first time Miguel had encountered bandits, but at least they didn’t seem to have guns. But they had his friend.\n\nA body slid through the hatch, but just as it landed, Miguel smashed its knees with his flashlight.

Turning around, Miguel drove the crowbar into the figure’s head. He heard a squishing sound but didn’t bother to shine a light on the remains.\n\nFilled with fury and encouraged by his momentary victory, Miguel climbed out and faced the remaining thug who threw the girl at the ground and reached into his pocket. Wasting no time, Miguel jumped off the vehicle and rushed him. The thug pulled out a pistol but, seeing Miguel running at him, turned to run. He was not fast enough, and Miguel hit him in the back of the head. The attacker fell and was beaten to death. Sirens wailed in the distance, but just as Miguel turned to his friend, she shrieked and ran away. It was only then, when the frenzy of battle ended, that Miguel realized the situation. He observed the bloody pulp beneath him and stood there in the alley, frozen. At first, he prayed that the day was not real, that it was all in his head. But as the sirens grew louder, he turned to praying and begged whatever higher power listened to restart the day. Miguel’s stomach twisted and his body refused to move."
  brazil.17.a:0 "Then the police arrived."
  brazil.18.t:0 "Prison"
  brazil.18.d:0 "Miguel paced around his small cell. The police department had clearly not invested in the living quarters of their prisoners for quite some time, and the walls were cracked and completely devoid of color. The bars were brown from rust, but the depressing environment that the youth found himself in did not concern him. Inside his head, he raged at the system. He conjured speeches to throw at the warden, he prepared a legendary defense for court, he recounted the happenings of the previous night and threw up into the overflown toilet when he remembered the crumbled bodies of the thugs he had beaten to death. At last, the jail door opened and an officer escorted Miguel out. He was ready to face the warden, the judge, whoever awaited him…\n\n… but then entered the lobby and saw his friend. The girl came up to him. She wore a blank expression but that said enough. The officer unlocked the shackles and told Miguel that everything had been sorted out. Miguel left with the girl. They came out into the street. The morning sun blinded Miguel and he could not look at her face. She said something tearfully, but he felt like his ears were stuffed with cotton and could not hear her. When his eyes had readjusted to the light, the girl was gone.\n\nMiguel wandered the streets and came to his apartment complex. He did not want to remember the previous night. He tried to think about the theater, the poetry he had written that summer, but he just longed for his mother’s embrace. He entered his apartment and said hello. There was nobody alive to hear him.\n\nMiguel’s mother had died of a stroke, maybe because she had not taken her medicine, maybe because she found out her son was in prison over killing two men, maybe when she saw a TV broadcast over banks freezing money. Miguel wondered whether she just did not want to live anymore now that her son was a killer. Self-defense, yes, but the innocence was spoiled. Miguel could not afford the cost of burial, so he had her cremated. He did not know how to run the house, pay the bills, or how and where to work for decent money."
  brazil.18.a:0 "He did not feel anything but emptiness."
  brazil.19.t:0 "Streets"
  brazil.19.d:0 "The house folded in a week. The landlord found out about the death and demanded a lump sum on ‘old rent’. Miguel, unsure of the legality of such an action, but also unsure of the wisdom in declining the landlord, sold what he could and took to the streets. The favelas had conquered Brasilia. The stench of garbage dumped by apartments and derelict buildings pervaded the air, but was not sufficient to drive off the beggars, who crowded around businesses like ants. The favelas were most dangerous at night, when petty gangs waged their war on each other, although sometimes the thin ranks of the police had to intervene. However, the day was not much safer. Recruiters from the West patrolled the streets with armed escorts and ‘volunteered’ people into the army. There was a war coming. In the inner cities, one could almost feel it: a tension that strengthened with every broadcast of preparations and agitation against the Andean Compact. The people of Brazil lived on a knife’s edge.\n\nMiguel passed through familiar streets he had walked as a child, then came out of the slums and onto an urban highway. The cars were few here. Those who owned one were afraid of highwaymen, those who did not had to travel miles on foot. Public transportation was dead, slain by constant muggings. Miguel had some cash from his late mother but did not want to risk it by contacting a shoe dealer. He had to walk in torn sandals. A band of kids passed him on the road. Miguel couldn’t tell whether they really were famished or were just trying to evoke help from a passer by, maybe lead one into an alley… Miguel avoided them. Soon the smell of landfills had passed, replaced by smog and industrial pollution. The clouds that hid the sun were hidden in turn by smoke, be it from burning waste or battles in the outskirts.\n\nThe truth was, and it took him a while to admit it, Miguel had no idea where he was going. He remembered the theater plays, where actors cried and wailed at the loss of close friends. Here he was, motherless, but there was nothing. He felt hollow, but that did not matter. The inner city was upon Miguel now, its skyscrapers towering over barely contained filth."
  brazil.19.a:0 "Miguel stopped at a pretty sign, and entered a bar."
  brazil.20.t:0 "Bar"
  brazil.20.d:0 "Imagination betrayed Miguel: the bar was nothing like his mind had pictured. Instead of a solemn place of revelry and pity, this bar was a madhouse. There were too many people, there was no space. The seats were taken up, the balcony had overflown, there was a fight somewhere on the other end, but few were bothered by the commission. The obnoxious music drowned out noise, forcing people to yell in conversations. Miguel wondered if all bars were like this if they were always like this. Momentarily he considered leaving, but he had nowhere else to go. A part of him wanted to anchor here, to make this pit his home, to feel the embrace of humanity and the warm feeling of having nothing to look forward to, nothing to fear from an uncertain future.\n\nMiguel navigated the crowd and came to the bartender. Few words were exchanged. Miguel found an unlit corner and sat there on the concrete floor, drinking something his mother warned him about long ago. A day passed. Then another. Time ceased to matter. The space never changed – Miguel took the immortal crowd for granted. From his corner he witnessed fights, stabbings, love, dealings, corruption and much more – but it was all too distant for him to care about. He hoped that, if he just kept drinking, it would all fade. Sometimes it did. One time, Miguel woke up and reached into his pockets to find nothing. He did not keep track of his money. Did someone pickpocket it? Or had Miguel spent it all already? He paced the bar. He shoved people aside without regard, he circled the four walls and the balconies. He lunged at coins on the floor, but even that was not enough. Miguel suffered the worst hangover of his life. He crawled back into his corner and grasped at his head. He wiped his eyes and eventually broke down in tears. Nobody noticed...\n\n… or so it seemed. The bartender materialized before him, holding a colorful drink. Miguel accepted it with shaking hands. The drink’s bright colors contrasted with the dark bar, a light in his darkness.\n\n‘It’s on your friend over there.’ the bartender pointed to a bearded man seated at the other end. Miguel nodded at him and raised the bottom. The bartender left; the bearded man came over. He squatted by Miguel and smiled with bright golden teeth"
  brazil.20.a:0 "‘Kid, I have an offer for you…’"
  brazil.21.t:0 "Offices"
  brazil.21.d:0 "Miguel did not trust the bearded man from the bar. He looked sketchy, dressed in his suit and tie, a stark contrast from the rest of the bar patrons. Miguel wondered why he hadn’t noticed him before. The man lit a cigar and pointed at the drink he had bought Miguel: ‘There’s more where that came from, kid.’ He beckoned him to follow, and Miguel, afraid of disrespecting a kind gesture, followed.\n\nThe bearded man introduced himself as Pablo, and led Miguel through a locked door of the bar and into a dark hallway, through some offices and to a desk. He motioned to a chair. Miguel sat down. For the first time in days (or was it weeks?) Miguel was alone with another man. He had forgotten what quiet sounded like.\n\n‘Kid, I have a proposition for you. See, I am a man of talent, and I can see that same talent in you.’ Miguel did not respond.\n\n‘Ah, but I see you are smart too. Ok, let’s get to it… here…’ the bearded man reached into his desk and produced a briefcase. He opened it and suddenly it was the only thing that mattered to Miguel. Money. Lots of money. The bearded man took a stack and handed it to Miguel. Bewildered, he could not decline. For the first time since his mother’s death, Miguel felt something deep in him, a calling. A way out. Energies he thought lost seemed to return to his muscles.\n\n‘Here, have some.’ the bearded man smiled, ‘and there’s more.’ He took another stack and offered it to Miguel, but quickly withdrew it. ‘Kid, you want to get rich? It ain’t easy these days. It takes a real smart man to get rich these days. A real smart man like yourself…’ Miguel nodded.\n\n‘Good, good…’ the man produced some papers, ‘you know of the war? Yeah, the war, it’s coming. Soon, soon, soon. They’re conscripting everyone, boys, girls, the poor, the poorer… you too, you know. Someday, the recruiters will show up to this bar and get you to sign up, like it or not.’ Miguel nodded in understanding.\n\n‘So why let the opportunity go to waste? There’s money to be made in war. And if you’re going to the front anyway, why not come out of it filled with money?’ the man leaned in, ‘Go to the nearest conscription center and enlist. It doesn’t matter where; it doesn’t matter what brigade. Go on, to whichever one you want. But when you get there, to the war, find an armory, get some weapons,’ the man chuckled, ‘you know what I’m saying, kid, right? Get to the armory and take some guns. A dear friend of mine says the military is starved, it can’t even afford camp guards. Piece of cake! Take the guns, take a truck, bring it to here:’ he pointed to the papers and handed them to Miguel."
  brazil.21.a:0 "Perhaps, there is a way out."
  brazil.22.t:0 "Recruitment Center"
  brazil.22.d:0 "The recruitment center wasn’t very far from the bar. Miguel, treated to the sun’s harsh rays for the first time in what felt like years, took a moment to wander the streets and ready himself. He had heard rumors. The military was recruiting everybody, young, old, healthy, crippled. The war would not be an easy one, but a victory there meant everything to Brazil’s future. Miguel paced the block between the recruiter’s office and the bar, occasionally looking up to observe the towering skyscrapers. One had the poster of President Velho across its lower half.\n\nFinally, realizing that he had crossed the point of no return long ago, Miguel walked into the recruitment office. The line was full. There was only one recruiter, an old man. When his turn came, Miguel was asked for his papers. He was then told to enter a repurposed meat truck behind the office which would take him to the barracks. All middlemen and middle processes had been cut.\n\nThe van contained twenty passengers, including Miguel. Most were his age. Nobody spoke except for a pair in the corner, who kept exchanging small green bags. The recruits drove out of the city and past Miguel’s favela. A fire had rampaged through the upper floors, and there were many bodies on the road. Many weren’t burned. The van then made it to the countryside, where even the rolling hills and tall grass couldn’t disguise blasted terrain and miles of dead farmland. The mountains came into view towards the end of the day. Suddenly remembering his task, Miguel glanced at the papers Pablo had handed him. He would have to take this road again to meet his contact on the way back."
  brazil.22.a:0 "The frontline grew nearer."
  brazil.23.t:0 "Barracks"
  brazil.23.d:0 "The recruits unloaded onto a mountain plateau before being greeted by a Sergeant Ze, who very eloquently asked them to fall in line and march into the barracks. The building itself was fairly isolated from the rest of the camp, which sprawled across the mountains and valley below. It was built into a mountain side, and Miguel noticed a small bunker entrance nearby, marked ‘Armory’. Seeing no guard, he breathed a sigh of relief. For a brief moment, he allowed imagination to take hold: if he could really pull this off, grab some guns and take a truck down (there were very few patrols in the area) to deliver the arms, he could become quite wealthy. Perhaps he could even find an old friend…\n\nBut Sergeant Ze yelled something, and everybody ran out back onto the plateau. The rest of the day consisted of marching, drilling, firing, crawling, and other tasks that everybody failed miserably at. Miguel paid no mind to the berating sergeant. He was fixated on the armory. While the recruits slept, he conjured plans and while they trained, he stared at the armory entrance and wandered if it was locked at all.\n\nThen, about a week into training, the top of a nearby mountain exploded. Then another. Soon an avalanche hit them, and the recruits had to wait until a tread cannon was brought in to clear the rubble. The skirmishes had begun, but the war still seemed too distant to Miguel, an obstacle on the path to rectifying his life. On the fourth week, Sergeant Ze was summoned to an officer meeting in another bunker, and the recruits were left alone. Someone had, somehow, sneaked in a green bag into the barracks and everybody was in wonderland. Miguel forced himself to abstain. He rolled around in his bed, walked the length of the bunker, took a shower. A part of him tried to delay his task, but he knew what had to be done. When the dark set in, he left the barrack and, as there were no guards on duty, walked to the armory door. It opened and racks of ancient guns greeted Miguel. He was astounded by such an array of weaponry. Putting his limited training to use for the first time, he identified the best rifles and stuffed them into his bag. The trucks were kept locked nearby, but with the war starting, all patrols were likely at the front already. But just as Miguel grabbed his fourth rifle, he heard the door slam open behind him and the recruits rushed in, followed by Sergeant Ze."
  brazil.23.a:0 "Miguel felt his heart sink."
  brazil.24.t:0 "The Front"
  brazil.24.d:0 "The night became day, illuminated by endless explosions. Andean bombers ripped apart the Brazilian bunkers, which in turn unleashed waves of soldiers and armor, occasionally making dents in the enemy’s frontline before being pushed back. Every so often an EMP went off, followed by many bodies falling into the chasms below. Entire battalions routed every day, some running East, others forced back into the fray with promises of pay or pain.\n\nMiguel’s group arrived on the bottom slope of a relatively short mountain. Sergeant Ze ordered everybody to ready themselves: ‘Boys and girls, welcome to the 23rd century! Now, originally our fine band was meant to supplement Salles’s 341st and reinforce an attack on Cuzco, but the 341st disappeared yesterday and Cuzco isn’t even close.’ He hesitated. ‘We will be attacking enemy fortifications along the 16th Parallel to the West. Now, Rodrigo’s group will provide artillery cover while we make our way up this mountain. Once we have reached the third main plateau, an avalanche will be triggered, during which time we will have to break into enemy bunkers and clear them out. Is that clear?’ nobody bothered to respond. The group marched on. Sergeant Ze shot a judgmental look at Miguel, but then smiled, ‘And you, you will have to work double to make up for that little stunt yesterday.’\n\nMiguel pulled his rifle close and ran on. The initial ascent was uneventful, until the sky exploded. He could make out men in the distance, like ants hurrying about their anthill, swarming over the mountains. Miguel tried to listen to the buzz of the artillery but could not make out which side was firing more. They reached the third plateau by midnight, yet the sky remained bright. The avalanche was not instigated, and they were fired upon. Miguel scrambled for cover, but the soldiers ahead of him were eviscerated. He stumbled into a ditch and lay there, too shocked to act, too shocked to cry. Sergeant Ze screamed a war cry in the distance and the world flooded white."
  brazil.24.a:0 "The battle continued into the next day."
  brazil.25.t:0 "Universities Close Down"
  brazil.25.d:0 "It began with the University of San Paulo, then the University of Brasilia, then they all shut their doors. Low attendance, either the fault of poverty or political agitation, was initially considered the primary cause for universities closing down. However, media investigations into the matter revealed that the heart of the issue lay in a shortage of staff. Statisticians believe that educated individuals have been fleeing the nation over the past two decades, while graduating students took residence in Europe and Africa before acquiring citizenship there. This resulted in a chain effect of urban universities closing, forcing potential students to work in the fields or the military, which in turn drove down enrollment elsewhere.\n\nIt seems that this problem was never considered by state officials, but now it is too late to rectify anything. The process of rebuilding higher level education is expected to take 3 years, which is the time estimated to acquire new human capital and reverse the brain drain. Promising students (based on school exit exam scores) have been given sufficient funding to travel to the few remaining universities in the interior and study there for two years, but they will have to repay this funding within 30 years."
  brazil.25.a:0 "We will do what we can."
  brazil.26.t:0 "The Survivalist Threat"
  brazil.26.d:0 "Due to extensive militarization across the Andean border, almost all units have been redeployed to the West. This has left the North and Northwest devoid of garrisons. While we originally expected unpoliced areas to devolve into anarchy sometime in the next two years, local guerillas have already acted. Moving under the protection of local villagers, survivalist cliques have achieved some degree of unity (according to bribed gang leaders) and have occupied many towns within the Northern coast. Police units have been able to protect major cities, but the countryside is effectively under survivalist control.\n\nUnless this situation is rectified soon, core cities will be facing famine within the year. Current stocks are sufficient for an estimated 9 months if rationed, but with the farms in anarchy, vertical agriculture will have no supplements and will require rapid expansion to stave off mass starvation. Unfortunately, the military is stretched thin and daily desertions demand a constant transfer of troops from garrisons to the Western borders. Beating the survivalists will have to wait until the upcoming Andean War is over, and even then, will be a tremendous effort. Nerve stapling units are on standby to quell famine uprisings. Let us hope we will not need to use them."
  brazil.26.a:0 "Our hands are tied!"
  brazil.27.t:0 "Watanabe’s Legacy"
  brazil.27.d:0 "Former President Watanabe, overthrown during the coup that put President Velho in power, still has many supporters in the South. During the tumultuous decade of the 2180s, Watanabe tried to compound on his predecessor’s short-lived reforms but failed due to obscene levels of corruption in the government. He was ousted when General Velho and the military stormed Brasilia and declared martial law. Watanabe and his staff managed to escape to the South via helicopter. Although their original plan was to wage a war against the military, poor militia organization led to his attempted revolt being crushed in a matter of weeks.\n\nWith no support and low popularity, Watanabe fled once again, this time to Cuzco in the Andean Compact. The Compact itself, once a great trading partner of Brazil, jumped on the opportunity to draft a subservient Brazilian government in-exile. Now, Watanabe bids his time in Cuzco, waiting for an opportune time to strike back and reclaim his country. Official reports have not considered him a credible threat since his failed uprising, but an unprecedented increase in protests down South has revealed that, even while in exile, Watanabe is covertly preparing another rebellion. The state lacks proper units to handle this mess, so President Velho will have to rely on popularity among the people to prevent a civil war."
  brazil.27.a:0 "O Brazil, how far have you fallen?"
  brazil.28.t:0 "Southern Agitation!"
  brazil.28.d:0 "As previously reported, urban clusters in the South have been experiencing an increase in unrest for several months. Unfortunately, earlier today, former university students have led a raid on state armories in Curitiba and stolen many weapons. Although army units drove them out a few hours ago, the armory has been almost completely emptied. When said units tried to pursue the fleeing rioters into the inner cities, they were assaulted by disgruntled workers. The troops tried to retreat and reorganize in the countryside but were cut off by farmers and dispersed. An entire garrison unit, totaling 10,000, has effectively ceased to exist. The Andean Front is too large to shift troops from, and all available police units have already been rerouted North to deal with the survivalists. It would not be an exaggeration to say that we have lost control over the South. As most of these rioters are supporters of former President Watanabe, San Paulo itself is guaranteed to come under threat in the event of civil war."
  brazil.28.a:0 "Get a hold of the situation, dammit!"
  brazil.29.t:0 "The Amazonian Guerillas"
  brazil.29.d:0 "Shortly after the Great Mistake, the Amazon Sea began to form. At first, there were reports of minor flooding in the center of the jungle. Then, the rivers overflowed. By the time situation awareness was established, the government was too busy with the worldwide economic collapse to deal with the flooding.\n\nNow, the Amazon Sea exists as a grim reminder of what happens when a country forgets its environment. Unfortunately, it seems that the land is not the only thing that the state forgot: the Amazon has been (and still is) inhabited by indigenous groups, anti-government guerillas, and refugees from Bolivar. These destitute souls have lived in complete poverty and anarchy ever since the Great Mistake, and the lack of attention paid to their struggles has bred a great hatred within them. For more than a century, dissidents, political enemies, deserters, and other misfits have been flowing into the Northwest.\n\nNow, the area is effectively outside government jurisdiction. All attempts at tax collection were halted back in the 2160s, and the last residing governor was evacuated by helicopter in 2189. Survivalist cliques thrive in the rainforest and have recently linked up with their counterparts in the Northern coasts. A united survivalist front is estimated to have both the manpower and arms capacity to launch a coup within the year."
  brazil.29.a:0 "Just smoke them out! How hard can it be?"
  brazil.30.t:0 "The Survivalists Take The Sertao!"
  brazil.30.d:0 "Before the Great Mistake, the Sertao was a relatively small desert in the Northeast of Brazil. Sparsely inhabited and always on the backburner of politics, few presidents ever bothered to reinforce it against rebellions. However, as the years dragged on and the worldwide climate deteriorated, the Sertao began swallowing adjacent lands. Now most of the Northeast has become desert, a popular attraction for dissidents seeking to take up arms against the regime.\n\nPatrolling the Sertao is nigh impossible due to logistical issues, but the desert’s inhabitants have never been a serious problem until now. Survivalist guerillas moving from the North have broken through the Salles Line, leaving everything behind them in disarray. Although armored units were summoned to hold the breach, they arrived too late and were forced on the retreat. Advancing survivalists (likely supported by Bolivar) have now occupied the upper half of the Sertao. Although this is not a significant loss, the fact that a group of disgruntled farmers managed to rout government divisions speaks volumes as to the state of the armed forces. Furthermore, the survivalists have local guides on their side, meaning that they can navigate the Sertao at astounding speeds, and strike anywhere in the North. In the event of a civil war, the North cannot be held for any period of time beyond a few weeks. The only respite for the state is that rebel groups are now somewhat overextended."
  brazil.30.a:0 "Let the rebels choke on their success!"
  brazil.31.t:0 "The Survivalists Reach The Sea!"
  brazil.31.d:0 "What the general staff feared has come to pass, as in the early hours of the day, the last outpost in the Northern Amazon went silent. The situation on the ground is clear: the survivalists, striking from both the inner Amazon and the North, have encircled and annihilated loyal garrisons around the Amazon Sea. All attempts at a break out by the trapped units have failed, and armored support failed to arrive at the necessary time due to logistical problems.\n\nNow that the Northern and Amazon survivalist cliques have linked up, they will be able to form a united front and move against the rest of Brazil like a wave moves against the beach. We cannot spare Andean garrisons due to the possibility of the Compact taking advantage of our weakness and attacking. So far, rebellious elements have been held at bay by their own petty squabbles. Already, several survivalist cliques have fallen into in-fighting, but not enough so as to completely cripple their revolution. Core cities have already been fortified, but we must prepare for the worst. Senior advisors believe that a civil war is imminent, one that we have a very low chance of surviving."
  brazil.31.a:0 "The situation has not developed to our advantage."
  brazil.32.t:0 "The Survivalists Fracture!"
  brazil.32.d:0 "We have been saved, at least for the time being. Reports from the North are scarce, but our remaining informants have confirmed that the North and Amazon have fallen into civil wars of its own. Survivalist groups, divided for as of yet unknown reasons, have fractured and fallen into complete disarray. Guerillas from the Amazon have launched a successful attack on Northern survivalist positions along the Amazon Sea, while the latter has been forced to withdraw from the Sertao due to overextension and internal squabbles.\n\nA leader by the name of Xemenes has reorganized the Amazonian survivalists into a coherent front, but his rebellion is nothing compared to the preceding united front. However, even Xemenes’s partisans seem to be split and prone to infighting. Our garrisons have already pressed this unexpected opportunity and recaptured rainforest strongpoints.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern survivalists have no unifying figure. Powerful warlords rise and fall on an almost daily basis, leaving their own front mismanaged. Similarly, our gallant defenders have retaken most of the North and driven remaining survivalists into the forests and hills. The Sertao has been surrounded and will be clear of rebel activity within the year."
  brazil.32.a:0 "The worst has passed… for now."
  brazil.33.t:0 "The Housing Market Collapses!"
  brazil.33.d:0 "Disaster! Real estate firms, retailers, and other associated businesses have fled Brazil! Citing a lack of sales and an unprecedented increase in asset destruction by rebel groups, many investors have liquated their stakes and moved to Europe and Africa. Although many real estate projects were already state controlled by 2195, the housing market was the primary driving force behind new constructions. With the businesses gone, the government will be forced to spend more on public infrastructure, but also without access to market specialists. Taxes will need to be increased this year, and inflation levels already broke all precedents this year. Other businesses, such as physical retailers, foreign manufacturers, infrastructure contractors and ARC officers are expected to leave Brazil in a similar manner if the economy does not improve."
