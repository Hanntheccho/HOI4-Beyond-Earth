 #Leaders
  FRA_elodie_batteux:0 "Élodie Batteux"
  FRA_elodie_batteux_desc:0 "Long wealthy, Élodie's lineage traces back to the nobility and privileged elite of France and Italy a millennia before the Great Mistake. Her family's prestige and influence was not, however, based on its peerage, but rather on the immense fortune it had amassed over the previous two centuries from its holdings in agriculture, food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles.\n\nBorn in Europe's foremost fertility and maternity clinic in Braga, Élodie was her parents' only child. Raised in luxury along the Cote d'Azur and the Costa del Sol, Élodie became a media darling as a teen, although not always portrayed in a flattering light. Accused by her detractors as an isolationist, and a European elitist, Élodie certainly possessed a famously acerbic tongue and quick wit. A strong believer in the value of the Western cultural tradition, she believed that it was up to the educated European elite to guide the masses for their betterment, ensuring the survival of high culture.\n\nThe best way to do this on Earth was the independence and sustainability of the new Union."
  FRA_al_hakim:0 "Al-Hakim"
  FRA_al_hakim_desc:0 "Al-Hakim is one of the most important people in the French political region. Born to an Algerian immigrant family in the now-flooded suburb of Saint-Quen, North Paris and brought up in the crime-infested neighbourhoods of the city, he would initially become a part of this dark underworld, but government initiatives designed to raise the delinquent youth out of the world of crime, saw great promise in Al-Hakim.\n\nTurning his life around, he began reading up on economics, philosophy, history and more, eventually writing his first book at the age of 23. This would kickstart Al-Hakim's widely popular literary career, culminating in highly successful but widely criticised "Hakim Manifesto". The book was infamous for its lambasting of 21st century culture and lifestyles, declaring the Great Mistake was caused by a group he calls the "Fake People" whilst fellow "True People" were disadvantaged. The historian community rejected the book, but it's contents were exactly what the populus of Franco-Iberia wanted to hear.\n\nEncouraged by millions of supporters, Al-Hakim would go on to use his newly-acquired wealth to found a new political party, the Partido Populaire, becoming the 2nd most powerful political force in Franco-Iberia, and continuing to gain supporters.\n\nUltimately, Hakim strives for complete social equality and a political rework, seeking to prevent "Fake People" from ever again coming to power."

 #Events
  franco_event.1.t: "Europe's Heritage"
  franco_event.1.d: "The Great Mistake shattered our world. Our North American allies, our middle-eastern interests, our African dependencies, even our trade partners from Argentina to Japan. And unfortunately, even our old, great, united Europe wasn't spared. After being a centre of conflict and strife for hundreds of years, we finally achieved peace. Ancient adversaries became friends and partners, bloodshed and war became history, with Europe becoming the most prosperous and peaceful region on the planet. It was a testament to the greatness of Western Civilization, a lynchpin for all humanity.\n\nBut the Great Mistake took it all. The European Union and NATO collapsed and disbanded, ancient capitals submerged in water, massive economic crisis and nuclear war - hundreds of years down the drain. Everything we've worked so hard to achieve - reduced to nothing. After the fallout, only three nations remained faithful to ideals of Old Europe. Portugal, Spain and France. Three countries united into a single entity now known as Franco-Iberia. A state built upon the great heritage of European civilization, we seek to uphold and restore what was lost due to the Mistake.\n\nOur approach to this goal will be determined by the current elections.Held between dozens of parties, according to our democratic traditions. There are two main candidates for victory. Élodie and her Partido Nationale are a conservative party, not only desiring to reclaim our lost power, but also cherish and celebrate Europe's rich culture, seeing the Age of Renaissance as its peak. They will also maintain current status-quo, seeing it as closest to perfection. Al-Hakim, the current candidate of Partido Populare calls for a different approach. Europe was always at the forefront of technological advancement, and a melting pot for all cultures, nations and ethnoses around the world. He sees those virtues and values as most important for us, seeing potential as the central piece of Franco-Iberia's future path, not its tradition. While great men and women debate endlessly about war, politics, and national philosophy, the future is still chosen by common folk all across our country."

The right to food, water, housing, healthcare and security, these things which for many generations have been subject to exploitation and restriction as a weapon of authority and power over the less fortunate. It is the declaration of this government that these things are not luxuries to be bought and fought for, but unassailable human rights, and that this government shall fight to preserve those rights under all circumstances, current and future."\n\n"Furthermore, an individual's right to self-determination and democracy shall be upheld for all law-abiding citizens of this nation, and that these freedoms and systems are to be safeguarded to the utmost by popularly elected officials, operating in good faith, and the people themselves in digital and physical public spaces open to all. It is the right of the people to be safeguarded by a democratic government of their peers, and the expectation of the people to provide that government the means and resources with which to do so.

The support of the people is assured and we can press forward, safe in the knowledge that the upstart ideals of the opposition have been thoroughly silenced.\n\nThere is much to be done, of course and matters across the continent must be addressed, namely the events unfolding in England, the growing tensions in the Balkans, and the concern of escalation with our rivals in the continent. We can turn to all of these, however, with a newfound reassurance that the status-quo will endure, and that a united identity for our nation and the continent as a whole is not far off!"

  franco_event.6.t: "Intervention In Balkan-Romanian War"
  franco_event.6.d: "Before the Great Mistake, the Balkan Peninsula was a troublesome place, often called the powder keg of Europe. Due to multitudes of different ethnicities, religions and ideologies existing in one, relatively small region, it was a constant battle of nationalistic and highly aggreissive states, that would fight, win and then lose in the same breath. Our choice back then was to allow every nationality a small state, preventing inhumanities, and weakening them so much that any offensive war would be an effective suicide.\n\nUnfortunately, it has been a while since that order has fallen, and the Balkans have continued their cycle once again. The so-called "Balkan Federation" on paper is supposed to be a democracy following Pan-Slavic goals; in reality, it is a smokescreen for Russian interests and naked corruption. We have had to tolerate its existence for some time, but after the unexpected full-scale invasion of Romania, Franco-Iberia has had to step in. Despite Romania's status as a pariah state due to their excessively brutal regime, they are a valuable ally in the Balkans. Our only dilemma - determining the scale of our intervention. The more we embroil ourselves in their affairs, the more will we be held accountable for the fallout, whatever it may be. At the same time, do too little - and we may sacrifice our staging ground in the east."

  franco_event.7.t: "The English Civil War"
  franco_event.7.d: "Of all the areas of opposing interests in Europe, England is perhaps the most contentious and multi-sided. For decades, England has been on a steady downhill slide into poverty and squalour following their losses in the Dark Days and a subsequent half-century of corrupt inaction by the current government, leading the majority of the English population to openly oppose the ruling system. Unfortunately, this widespread opposition has become common knowledge among our rivals, and the outbreak of violence has resulted in a four-sided conflict across the nation.\n\nIn the north and east, the remnants of the old English government have held onto strategic control, and direct Scottish intervention is not expected, given fears of escalation into a wider conflict. In the east, an ecological front has opened up, filled mostly with youths and students, and no doubt supported by INTEGR across the sea. In the far south just over the channel, a small and independent force of militia has seized several locations, but are expected to soon be overwhelmed by their enemies and are of little concern to us.\n\nIn the English 'Home Counties', however, is where our investments lie. A retired English general by the name of Nigel John-Hall leads a paramilitary clique of what can best be described as technophobes, authoritarians and luddites in all but name. While we are loath to associate ourselves with a populist dictator and his hate-filled rabble, we are willing to accept the ideological differences to gain a stake on the British Isles, and this John-Hall will likely prove himself an effective leashed dog, if nothing else.\n\nWe must be careful how far we intervene, however. England is a hotbed of strongly opposing interests, and because of this, direct intervention is out of the question."
  franco_event_option.7.a: "Do nothing..."

  franco_event.8.t: "Parlez-vous Anglais?"
  franco_event.8.d: "Hello, hello? Is this thing working properly? I can’t seem to see you on the…screen- thingy." Nigel John-Hall began arbitrarily hitting buttons until his video call began working. "Ah, there we go. To be honest mate, I don’t see why we can’t just send a message or have a phone call or send a letter or something." Nigel stared at the screen, confused at not getting any response. "Uhh, parlez-vous Anglais?" His pronunciation was like a bad joke.\n\n"I can understand you, Monsieur John-Hall, my application comes with a translator. I’m just amazed you’ve not used a video caller before." Élodie furrowed her brow and carried on with the ‘conversation’. "So, I’ve heard you’ve managed to take control of England, yes?"\n\n"Yes." It came out more of a murmur.\n\n"We have a selection of topics to discuss then. First things first, I assume this is a given, but do you plan on staying a part of our sphere, alliance, whatever you may call it? I know England isn’t on the mainland, but I would assume you’d like to ascend to some greater European state or alliance in the future?"\n"No love, that’s simply not going to happen, you see-"\n"Please, just stop right there. Our relationship can’t go only one way, we need to see commitment from you too."\n"Well of course it can go one way, I’m not into birds." John-Hall gave himself a wry chuckle, Élodie gave him a disgusted glare.\n\n"You’ve attempted to try and wriggle out of responsibility in our previous messages, I’ve tried to be lenient with your demands before, but they are simply unrealistic. A united Europe must include Britain to be truly legitimate."\n "No no no no, your demands are unrealistic, England can’t survive under a united Europe, your mechanisms and contraptions will corrupt our people and force them out of work!" Nigel’s face turned as red as his suit.\n\nÉlodie lifted her head and replied. "You won’t survive against the NSA without our help and protection, we can give you some autonomy and allow you to make some decisions, you have a relatively good taste in culture and strategy for an Englishman."\n"For an Englishman?"\n"However, on political and economic matters, we strongly advise that you defer to our advisors. No co-operation, no protection, no economic assistance. And yes, we will try and hold off on exporting machinery and technology to England for now. But you must keep your end of the deal. Also keep your men in better order, we already have enough on our hands with the Romanians."\n\nJohn-Hall grumbled dejectedly before nodding and ending the call. Élodie turned to an advisor taking notes and simply said…"

  #franco_event.9.t: "The Irish Faux-Pas"
  #franco_event.9.d: "Our closest approximation of an ally in England has always been something of a loosely reined animal, but his most recent actions have been a step toward disaster. For many years, the rural Irish populace has not always been loyal to their NSA Government following extensive automation, monopolization and exploitation. This was always a route of political exploitation, but for many other reasons, any form of support or intervention was seen as too much of a risk to continental peace to be worth it. It seems John-Hall has no such concerns however, as over the past months - without our authorization - he has been funnelling arms and propaganda into the nation to attempt to incite a popular uprising with no regard for the potential consequences.\n\nWe cannot deny the reckless nature and the disastrous consequences this may have, but it must also be said that John-Hall's efforts have been far more successful than we had ever expected from any incitement of our own, and the ongoing battle in Ireland holds a genuine chance of swaying the island to our alliance.\n\nEnough time has passed now, however, that it seems the uprising could go either way. We have the opportunity to send aid of our own to turn the tide, but doing so will effectively give our stamp of approval to the uprising, and to John-Hall's reckless attitude; something that will no doubt inflame the already high tensions across the continent."

  franco_event.10.t: "Italian Invasion"
  franco_event.10.d: "Ever since Padania seceded from Italy over 40 years ago by referendum, the peninsula has become a slowly boiling pot of tension as the Italian government and populace grew resentful of their new, wealthier northern neighbour. Acquati’s Partito Sociale government has further fanned anti-Padania sentiment - now culminating in a full-scale Italian invasion.\n\n Padania has sought to portray itself as a neutral beacon of progress in the 23rd century, but the invasion leaves them no room to reject our aid. Though they may be hesitant now, securing the allegiance of Padania through its defence will be one step further to realizing European unity\n\nWe must beware of our extent of support, however, as our rivals move to oppose us in the south. The Germans – and the wider INTEGR alliance – have an interest in supporting the Italian government. We will be watching closely to ensure our rivals do not get too involved in the conflict – as they will surely be doing with us."

Padania will undoubtedly fall to rival influence were it to succeed in its defence, and in these times of tension and diplomatic manoeuvring, we cannot allow that to happen.\n\nItaly will be far more open to our new government, and will be much more receptive to our aid, but we must take care. Our rivals on the continent will be watching closely, and getting ourselves too involved in a war at this time could only inflame the already high tensions."

  franco_event.12.t: "This Just In"
  franco_event.12.d: "When the world advanced past the 21st century, many hoped the days of anarchy were over. But like those who entered the 21st century from the 20th, they were wrong. Events that would occur once in a lifetime now happened weekly. And of course, it was the media’s job to inform the public of what was going on. And to make a buck from it.\n“Okay, are we rolling?... Hello, this is Liane Noyer of FLNN live from the streets of Strasbourg near the German border. The situation here is…dangerous to say the least.” Noyer stepped aside, allowing her viewers to see what was happening. One could easily compare it to the Catalonian riots of the 21st century.\nFire ruled the streets, Cars and automated delivery vehicles were wrecked, dented with steel poles and bats. Windows smashed with rocks, bricks, and even a few Molotov Cocktails. Whatever rioters could get their hands on, they threw. Behind the reporter, lines of riot police marched forward, shields and batons at the ready. A wall against the tidal wave of rioters.\n“No official word had been given about the cause of this unrest, though unverified sources have claimed it has originated from an environmental protest against industrial expansion in this region. Possibly in response to the construction of a large state-run factory complex on the outskirts of the city. The largest of the environmental groups that operate in Strasbourg, known as ‘Locals Against Exploitation’ or ‘LAE’, is believed to have ties to INTEGR. If this group is responsible, then could this be a sign of efforts by foreign powers to foment insurrection within our borders? Only time can tell. This is Liane Noyer of FLNN-”\n\nBANG!\n\n Noyer and her cameramen immediately ducked, and any sense of stability in the footage died as it blurred from the rapid movement. The camera managed to focus on the line of riot police. Chaos expanded rapidly now, the once stable line barely held together. As rioters rammed against the shield wall, the police responded with batons and tear gas.\n\nBANG! BANG!\n\nMore shots ring true, as Noyer ran with her camera following closely.\n “I…I can’t believe it!” She said frantically, barely able to speak as she ran, “Shots have been fired! I repeat shots have been-”\nBZZT.\nStatic ruled the screens for a moment, before returning to the studio. Those sitting comfortably in the office gave half sincere words of hope before they returned to their scheduled programming. But it was in everyone’s minds now; the people saw what happened. Theories formed in minutes, and by the end of the hour, entire chat groups were dedicated to placing blame. But whether it was the rioters or the police, everyone shared the same thought about whom they believed were responsible."

  #FRA_francois_dupont:0 "Francois Dupont"
  #FRA_francois_dupont_desc:0 "François Dupont served in the military police at the end of the Dark Days, only to be promoted to general after the mass departure of veterans. He never participated directly in a war, but his work within the friendly lines earned him a reputation as an iron fist, especially with immigrants, political prisoners and his own comrades. He always maintained a nationalist discourse in favour of the Union, accompanied by a ridiculously centralised and unified vision of it. Anyone who held an opinion contrary to his own became ungrateful to him.\n\nHe trained at the military academy in Paris, and was active in the then Parti Unioniste Conservador, which was based in the same city. The party was dissolved after his promotion and he joined the Partido Nationale. Although he did not consider himself a supporter of Élodie, he always supported the new party and his country with pride.\n\nWhile his own friends describe him as a steadfast and consistent person, what stands out most about Dupont is his high motive for power, his hidden ambition, his wet dream to reform the Federation into a strong state capable of standing up to its enemies and to itself. One that can maintain its personality and not allow others to destroy its culture, whatever the cost. His pride in Franco-Iberia is unparalleled, and he would do anything in his power to keep it alive. For Dupont, what his country stands for is not just Westernism, but purity, character, strength and brotherhood among its members, and freedom for those who accept it as such."

The authorities were caught off guard by the situation and several dozen people were killed and hundreds injured. More are still to come. The judicial system is overwhelmed, the prisons are at capacity, the police cannot cope with all the violent gatherings.\n\nThe media feed the situation with dramatic images, viral videos of police beating demonstrators. In the military command, some soldiers and generals have shown their disagreement with the government and the way it is handling the situation.

Dupont officially declared a coup d'état and a state of national emergency. More soldiers and generals quickly joined the coup, protecting the Assembly and firing on some demonstrators. The confused population has largely returned home to follow the situation from safety. Some protesters remain in the streets, but are quickly reduced by the military. The media stay as far away from the soldiers as possible, as some equipment has been destroyed by them.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Conseil Nacional d'Urgence is now meeting in the Assembly's presidential chamber."
