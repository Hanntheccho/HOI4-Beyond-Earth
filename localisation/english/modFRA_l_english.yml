 FRA_elodie_batteux_desc:0 "\n\n\n£elodie_batteux_text\n\n\n\n\n\nLong wealthy, Élodie's lineage traces back to the nobility and privileged elite of France and Italy a millennia before the Great Mistake. Her family's prestige and influence was not, however, based on its peerage, but rather on the immense fortune it had amassed over the previous two centuries from its holdings in agriculture, food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles.\n\nBorn in Europe's foremost fertility and maternity clinic in Braga, Élodie was her parents' only child. Raised in luxury along the Cote d'Azur and the Costa del Sol, Élodie became a media darling as a teen, although not always portrayed in a flattering light. Accused by her detractors as an isolationist, and a European elitist, Élodie certainly possessed a famously acerbic tongue and quick wit. A strong believer in the value of the Western cultural tradition, she believed that it was up to the educated European elite to guide the masses for their betterment, ensuring the survival of high culture.\n\nThe best way to do this on Earth was the independence and sustainability of the new Union."
 FRA_al_hakim:0 "Al-Hakim"
 FRA_al_hakim_desc:0 "\n\n\n£al_hakim_text\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Hakim is one of the most important people in the French political region. Born to an Algerian immigrant family in the now-flooded suburb of Saint-Quen, North Paris and brought up in the crime-infested neighbourhoods of the city, he would initially become a part of this dark underworld, but government initiatives designed to raise the delinquent youth out of the world of crime, saw great promise in Al-Hakim.\n\nTurning his life around, he began reading up on economics, philosophy, history and more, eventually writing his first book at the age of 23. This would kickstart Al-Hakim's widely popular literary career, culminating in highly successful but widely criticised "Hakim Manifesto". The book was infamous for its lambasting of 21st century culture and lifestyles, declaring the Great Mistake was caused by a group he calls the "Fake People" whilst fellow "True People" were disadvantaged. The historian community rejected the book, but it's contents were exactly what the populus of Franco-Iberia wanted to hear.\n\nEncouraged by millions of supporters, Al-Hakim would go on to use his newly-acquired wealth to found a new political party, the Partido Populaire, becoming the 2nd most powerful political force in Franco-Iberia, and continuing to gain supporters.\n\nUltimately, Hakim strives for complete social equality and a political rework, seeking to prevent "Fake People" from ever again coming to power."

 #Events
  #franco_event.1.t: "Franco-Iberia, a dream come true"
  #franco_event.1.d: "Following the disolussion of the European Union in the mid 21st century, the French and Iberian nations found common aims. Initially an alliance of necessity, the Franco-Iberian Federation developed to become a country in its own right.\n\nConsidering itself to be the last bastion of true democracy and the defender of Western Civilization, the Federation seeks to expand its reach across the globe. In Europe, the Federation prides itself as the dominant power, both economically and militarily."
  #franco_event_option.1.a: "Like a phoenix, we have returned!"
  #franco_event.2.t: "A Cultural Boom!"
  #franco_event.2.d: "What else needs to be said about Franco-Iberia? Probably the most stable country on Earth, one of the most prosperous economies, the shining beacon of democratic values and now, a heartland for cultural innovation.\n\nRecently, new city-planning techniques, building design and institutions have propped up and fantastical forms of art and entertainment are providing newfound hope and happiness for the masses. At the forefront of this cultural renaissance, are people like Marcial Azahar and Victorino Hadrien, two giants of architecture and city planning who are working closely with city officials, and even space colonization experts, to bring the future to the present.\n\nIn Entertainment and Art, new videogames, films, and interactive entertainment are equally transforming Franco-Iberian culture. One example is director Myriam Marthe, a star in the European film industry, whose revolutionary film style has created an entirely new genre: Marthe-ism.\n\nThrough these brilliant minds and many more, we can surely expect Franco-Iberia to push to the infinite."
  #franco_event_option.2.a: "Is Hearts of Iron 10 out yet?"
  #franco_event.3.t: "Andalusian Solar Thermal Plant"
  #franco_event.3.d: "Construction has begun in Franco-Iberia, in the region of Andalusia, of a massive 6th gen Solar Thermal Plant. The plant has been a massive economic endeavour with construction expected to be complete in about a year. Andalusia is also one of the sunniest and warmest regions of not just Iberia but all of Europe, and so energy output is expected to be tremendous.\n\nUnlike the common solar panel, the plant uses mirrors to reflect sunlight and boil a central steam generator, making the components required significantly cheaper. Already, multiple thousands of reflective panels are being brought in and, according to the architects, the central tower will be over 200 metres tall, a massive monument to Franco-Iberian ambition."
  #franco_event_option.3.a: "Wait, how many mirrors?"
  #franco_event.4.t: "The APOLLO Project"
  #franco_event.4.d: "The holy grail of physics, the elusive culmination of human mastery, a working nuclear fusion reactor, has just been engineered. Long thought out-of-reach by much of the scientific community or even physically impossible by many critics, a crude but functional prototype named "Apollo" has stunned much of the world.\n\nThis brilliant construct built by Dr. John Atkins and his team has now drawn mass attention from the entire scientific community. By inputting lightweight hydrogen isotopes into an electromagnetically stable chamber and giving it a quick jolt of energy, Atkins has been able to create a reliable and long-lasting source of electricity that may be the key to interstellar travel and humanity's future energy problems.\n\nNow, with his paper on the device just now being published, it's expected that government agencies and institutions around the world may soon begin construction of their own fusion reactors."

  #francoemergency_event.1.t: "Violent Demonstrations in Paris"
  #francoemergency_event.1.d: "Franco-Iberia can take no more. The nation is rising up and coming out of its homes, vandalising streets and shops. One of the largest demonstrations ever seen recently took place in Paris, without warning, and it continues to grow. The authorities were caught off guard by the situation and several dozen people were killed and hundreds injured. More are still to come. The judicial system is overwhelmed, the prisons are at capacity, the police cannot cope with all the violent gatherings.\n\nThe media feed the situation with dramatic images, viral videos of police beating demonstrators. In the military command, some soldiers and generals have shown their disagreement with the government and the way it is handling the situation. Regional leaders are agreeing to leave the Federation and take matters into their own hands.\n\n§RThe situation is dire.§!"

  #francoemergency_event.2.t: "Coup d'état in Paris"
  #francoemergency_event.2.d: "A few hours ago the military arrived in Paris. A group of soldiers commanded by François Dupont entered the National Assembly and threatened to kill everyone there.\n\n§RÉlodie, who was gathered there, was accidentally shot and died shortly afterwards§!. She could not be taken to a hospital in time due to the situation on the streets.\n\nOther politicians were injured, but most were obedient. Dupont officially declared a coup d'état and a state of national emergency. More soldiers and generals quickly joined the coup, protecting the Assembly and firing on some demonstrators. The confused population has largely returned home to follow the situation from safety. Some protesters remain in the streets, but are quickly reduced by the military. The media stay as far away from the soldiers as possible, as some equipment has been destroyed by them.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Conseil Nacional d'Urgence is now meeting in the Assembly's presidential chamber."
