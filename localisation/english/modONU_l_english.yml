  ONU_pravin_lal:0 "Pravin Lal"
  ONU_pravin_lal_desc:0 "Pravin Lal was born to a long line of UN Peacekeepers in New England, 2166. His education culminated in degrees in philosophy and medicine from Arcopolis, after which he returned to the countryside to work as a thoracic surgeon. In the aftermath of ARC's expansion into New England, Lal earned widespread acclaim for his selfless devotion to victims of radiation burns. His experience with the horrors of war took him into U.N. office. He served in the village of I Made It for many months, finally reaching the post of Assistant Director of the regional office. The divisions following the 3rd American Civil War led to Lal proving himself a capable military commander against raiders. Unfortunately, Lal's wife, Pria, was mortally injured in a firefight during Young Oyster's Raid, although there are rumors of him having preserved a piece of her DNA. Little information about Pria or Lal's past with her is publicly available.\n\nPravin Lal is a strong idealist, the epitome of the best nature of Earth's world community. Seeks to de-escalate conflict and create harmonious environments. Able to perform well under extreme pressure; score .87 on Atherholt Trauma Function Test (recovery score moderate). He is a democrat and pragmatist by nature, and will follow those ideals as far as he possibly can."

 #Focuses
  ONU_the_untana_regime:0 "The UNTANA Regime"
  ONU_the_untana_regime_desc:0 "The United Nations Transitional Authority of North America will everything that the North American Union wasn’t - a society where the long-lost ideals of democracy, human rights and humanitarianism will be held as virtues of the highest order. Or, at least, UNTANA will be the foundations for such a society. It will take decades to realize, but the end result will one day uphold America’s dormant dreams."
  ONU_restore_civilian_rule:0 "Restore Civilian Rule"
  ONU_restore_civilian_rule_desc:0 "We cannot pretend to uphold democratic values if we remain a military junta. Many are already cynical that we will simply repeat the same lies as the Central government or the US remnants. As a show of good faith, we will return to civilian governance and begin holding votes for regional representatives. Once the voting infrastructure in place and tested by these regional elections, we will soon be able to vote for a Secretary-General, proving our dedication to democracy once and for all."
  ONU_begin_assimilation_campaigns:0 "Begin Assimilation Campaign"
  ONU_begin_assimilation_campaigns_desc:0 "While we may afford ourselves a moment of reprieve at our victory in North America, far greater challenges lie ahead. Humanity is at a crossroads, and is already walking down the path of violent nationalism and petty division: the same path that led to the Great Mistake to begin with. We cannot survive another catastrophe of that magnitude. If we are to save humanity, we must face the challenges of the world as a united species. The challenges to reach that point will be tremendous, but the cost of failure is even greater."
  ONU_rebuilding_america:0 "Rebuilding America"
  ONU_rebuilding_america_desc:0 "The United States of America once stood for so many of the values we cherish. It is only appropriate that the hill that shining city once stood on is now the heart of our efforts to bring democracy and dignity back to the world. But even restoring order to North America will be a massive undertaking, considering the anarchic conditions that festers within it. But the lessons we learn from the reconstruction will provide a blueprint we can apply to other areas. if the UN can rebuild America, then it will prove itself capable of doing the same to the world as a whole."
  ONU_unnabar:0 "UNNABAR"
  ONU_unnabar_desc:0 "The job of the United Nations North American Board For Assimilation And Restructuring will not be an easy one. They, more than any other, will be responsible for rebuilding some semblance of a unified society in a long-fractured North America. The administrative apparatuses we’ve seized are still filled with NAU nationalists and ARC loyalists, and UNNABAR will be tasked with bringing them around to our way of thinking. Meanwhile, the countryside is dotted with religious extremists and hardened survivalists, who UNNABAR will have to bring back into civilized society. There will be some on both fronts too obstinate to cooperate, but they will be a matter for the Blue Helmets to deal with in the interests of public safety."
  ONU_fix_the_coastal_divide:0 "Fix The Coastal Divide"
  ONU_fix_the_coastal_divide_desc:0 "The North American coasts are graveyards of the old world; where once stood the mightiest cities in the world now lie flooded ruins and wartorn countryside. Reversing the damage of the Great Mistake is a truly Herculean task that we may never truly complete, but the North American coasts are as good a place as any to start."
  ONU_rebuild_the_highways:0 "Rebuild The Highways"
  ONU_rebuild_the_highways_desc:0 "America was once crisscrossed by one of the most complex highway systems in the world. It now exists as a shadow of its former self, laid low by the Great Mistake, by subsequent conflicts, and in many areas by plain and simple neglect. Rebuilding these highways will be crucial in mobilizing military and humanitarian assets, as well as rebuilding a continent-spanning economy."
  ONU_un_economic_and_social_council:0 "UN Economic And Social Council"
  ONU_un_economic_and_social_council_desc:0 "All the ideals and goodwill in the world will not fund our plans for it. We’ve done remarkably well to even reach this point, but improvised workshops and hijacked ARC factories cannot sustain us forever. It will fall upon the Economic and Social Council to build up our economic and industrial capabilities, and to do so in ways that upholds our values as much as possible."
  ONU_integrate_world_economies:0 "Integrate World Economies"
  ONU_integrate_world_economies_desc:0 "Prior to the Great Mistake, the world economy was globalized like never before. Not only are those days long gone, but national economies are in increasingly haphazard condition or esoteric structure. Integrating the economies of liberated regions will be a tremendous challenge, with no one-size-fits-all process for doing so. But that doesn’t make the task any less crucial to our efforts."
  ONU_ecosoc_elections:0 "ECOSOC Elections"
  ONU_ecosoc_elections_desc:0 "Considering its importance to our goals, we must ensure that the Economic and Social Council remains transparent and as free of corruption as possible. Instead of placing it in the hands of unelected bureaucrats, we will open the appointment process to voting by regional representatives."
  ONU_establish_the_oios:0 "Establish The OIOS"
  ONU_establish_the_oios_desc:0 "Corruption and waste have laid low even the mightiest nations, and we must take every effort to avoid such pitfalls. That is why the Office of Internal Oversight Services will be tasked with monitoring, auditing and regulating UN activities to ensure institutional integrity and efficiency across our burgeoning organization."
  ONU_who_development_fund:0 "WHO Development Fund"
  ONU_who_development_fund_desc:0 "The World Health Organization has its work cut out for it. Antibiotic-resistant superbugs, rogue bioweapons and environmental contaminants ravage the population, while widespread poverty and pressure on surviving medical infrastructure make any attempt at addressing health crises fraught with difficulty. By establishing a fund for building new hospitals and researching new medicines, we can begin working towards a healthier world, as distant as that goal may be."
  ONU_form_the_principal_organs:0 "Form The Principal Organs"
  ONU_form_the_principal_organs_desc:0 "The principal organs of the old UN were once the heart of the international community. So shall they be again, but this time for a global government. The Secretariat will be the administrative branch. The General Assembly will serve as a worldwide parliament. The International Criminal Court of Justice will restore international law. The Economic and Social Council will lead the fight to rebuild from the Great Mistake. And the Security Council will lead the fight to bring peace and stability to our stricken world."
  ONU_draft_specialized_agencies:0 "Draft Specialized Agencies"
  ONU_draft_specialized_agencies_desc:0 "Besides the principal organs, the United Nations consisted of many specialized agencies, promoting international cooperation across various fields. If we are to halt Earth’s decline and even begin to recover from the Great Mistake in earnest, then international cooperation will be more important than ever. These agencies must not only return, but come back as strong and impactful as possible."
  ONU_the_secretary_general_election:0 "The Secretary General Election"
  ONU_the_secretary_general_election_desc:0 "Our local elections have proven mostly successful, though a few kinks are currently being ironed out. But we are now in a position to hold elections for our Secretary General. Holding an election of this magnitude is unprecedented, but it’s only appropriate that it revives the dreams of American democracy in the process."
  ONU_rebuild_the_unwto:0 "Rebuild The UNWTO"
  ONU_rebuild_the_unwto_desc:0 "The role of the United Nations World Tourism Organization is an anachronistic one in a world where tourism is a dead industry. Widespread poverty, collapse of international travel and the ever-looming spectre of conflict make it rare for travel between nations outside of corporate business, governmental affairs or military invasion. But tourism is a constructive tool for forging cultural bonds and understanding, which we cannot overlook if we are to build a truly global society."
  ONU_form_the_unso:0 "Form The UNSO"
  ONU_form_the_unso_desc:0 "While the idealised dreams of space travel coming from a place of global harmony never came to fruition, many 20th and 21st century efforts were surprisingly international. Where the International Space Station left off, the United Nations Space Organization will resume. Today it will help us rebuild our satellite networks and restore our lunar colonies, in the hopes that tomorrow it may allow us to mine bountiful asteroids or even reach new worlds."
  ONU_fulfilling_our_destiny:0 "Fulfilling Our Destiny"
  ONU_fulfilling_our_destiny_desc:0 "The world may have fallen far, but its fate is not yet sealed. We can still unite as a species, upholding the values of peace and freedom as we rebuild a new world for everyone to enjoy. But it becomes clearer with each passing day that this will not come easily. In our way stands shortsighted nationalists, obstinate reactionaries and psychopathic corporate sycophants, all willing to sacrifice humanity’s future for their own gain. We have to accept that many will not join our cause willingly, but that cannot deter us."
  ONU_proclaim_the_unification_conflict:0 "Proclaim The Unification Conflict"
  ONU_proclaim_the_unification_conflict_desc:0 "It is clear that few nations will cede authority to us by force. Whatever their reasons, we cannot waste time trading empty words while the people of Earth suffer. Only we can offer humanity a true future, and we will see it secured at all costs."
  ONU_unseco_world_heritage_sites:0 "UNESCO World Heritage Sites"
  ONU_unseco_world_heritage_sites_desc:0 "The world has lost so much to the Great Mistake. Cultural heritage, scientific advancements and innumerable innocent lives were lost in quantities that even today we cannot fully grasp. This catastrophe cannot be allowed to be repeated. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization will not only facilitate intellectual cooperation across fields vital to human survival, but ensure that world heritage sites - both existing and new - will be preserved so that future generations will never lose them."
  ONU_force_commander_office:0 "Force Commander Office"
  ONU_force_commander_office_desc:0 "While our Blue Helmets have done an admirable job liberating America, their duty to save humanity has only just begun. In order to facilitate their mission, we will establish a new Force Commander Office as the capstone of our reorganized Peacekeeping Forces. While they can be vetoed by the Security Council, our Force Commander will be the highest ranking leader of the Peacekeeping Forces. Their appointment marks the beginning of transitioning the Forces from an overgrown militia to a world-class military."
  ONU_reestablish_human_rights:0 "Reestablish Human Rights"
  ONU_reestablish_human_rights_desc:0 "In a world of growing conflict, widespread poverty and perpetual ‘emergency powers’, human rights are rapidly becoming forgotten. Even the most democratic of nations look to strongarm their people to serve misguided national interests or indulge in petty power-plays. While the UN is not free of sin in that regard, we are at least willing to try and uphold our values. By bringing back the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, offering them to all regardless if they stand by us or not, we will send a powerful statement to the world that we will stand by our ideals."
  ONU_choose_a_stance_on_augmentation:0 "Choose A Stance On Augmentation"
  ONU_choose_a_stance_on_augmentation_desc:0 "Cybernetic and genetic augmentation are increasingly commonplace technologies, and their usage is highly controversial. From religious claims about profaning the human body to transhuman ideals about the next step in evolution, passions are inflamed by debates surrounding the technology. We must choose a stance to better dictate our policies moving forward."
  ONU_ai_rights_issue:0 "AI Rights Issue"
  ONU_ai_rights_issue_desc:0 "While debates over human augmentation still ultimately center around human beings, this is less clear in the field of Artificial Intelligences. Advanced AI are increasingly commonplace in governments and corporations, assisting or even replacing humans on a variety of tasks. As these AIs grow increasingly commonplace and sophisticated, we will need to address the fears and opportunities that have sprung up around them."
  ONU_dpo_organization:0 "DPO Organization"
  ONU_dpo_organization_desc:0 "The Department of Peacekeeping Operations will form the main administrative branch of the Peacekeeping Forces under the Force Commander’s Office. While it is not responsible for strategic decisions, it provides crucial legal oversight and logistical coordination, including centralised leadership of recruitment and training."
  ONU_unstratcom:0 "UNSTRATCOM"
  ONU_unstratcom_desc:0 "United Nations Strategic Command will be the nexus of our global peacekeeping operations. Equipped with the most cutting-edge technology and the finest military minds we can muster, UNSTRATCOM will command our forces on a strategic level. The decisions made among its ranks will mean the difference between our triumph in saving humanity or falling into failure once more."
  ONU_untaccom:0 "UNTACCOM"
  ONU_untaccom_desc:0 "“Where STRATCOM commands our forces on a strategic level, United Nations Tactical Command will do so on the tactical. Split into distinct but interconnected regional jurisdictions, it will coordinate with officers on the ground to plan and execute operations in all corners of the globe."
  ONU_un_space_forces:0 "UN Space Forces"
  ONU_un_space_forces_desc:0 "The days where land, naval and air forces were the sole branches of the military are gone. Increasingly, space is becoming a new frontier of warfare, and one we cannot afford to ignore. While it may be a long time before we’re deploying orbitally-dropped shock troopers, we can at least begin drawing up plans for aircraft capable of operation in low Earth orbit."
  ONU_blue_helmet_deployment:0 "Blue Helmet Deployment"
  ONU_blue_helmet_deployment_desc:0 "Winning a war still runs the risk of losing the peace. Even in the territory we do liberate, misguided partisans and deranged holdouts still pose tremendous risk to our personnel and the civilian population. We will need to ensure that a sufficient number of peacekeepers are deployed to liberated territory to provide safety and stability, even if it means redoubling our recruitment efforts to keep up with demand."
  ONU_the_peacekeeper_model:0 "The Peacekeeper Model"
  ONU_the_peacekeeper_model_desc:0 "No matter what, we cannot lose sight of the fact that our forces are not just soldiers, but peacekeepers. While they will need to paradoxically fight to bring peace, they will still be bringing hope to regions that have not known safety or stability since the Great Mistake. Peace may be a fleeting dream to many, but there will come a day when our forces bring it to them."
  ONU_integrate_global_general_staffs:0 "Integrate Global General Staffs"
  ONU_integrate_global_general_staffs_desc:0 "As we liberate nations of the world, we cannot overlook the value of incorporating their national militaries into our own. While we many once have been enemies, it’s possible to make use of their experiences for our own gain. We can convince those who fight out of a love for their country that we are their best option for protecting it, while those who joined the army for food and shelter will be easily bribed. Even so, we will need to be on the lookout for nationalist sentiment, which could very easily sabotage our efforts if left untreated."
  ONU_found_the_pcrs:0 "Found The PCRS"
  ONU_found_the_pcrs_desc:0 "The Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System is an ambitious program to establish our Peacekeeping Forces as a true global military. No longer will they be a patchwork of national militaries or an underequipped post-Mistake militia, but a military force ready to liberate the world and protect humanity. Such an undertaking is without precedence, but it is too important for us to pull any stops."
  ONU_over_the_atlantic:0 "Over The Atlantic"
  ONU_over_the_atlantic_desc:0 "While Europe has survived the Great Mistake in far better condition than many other areas, it is rapidly becoming a flashpoint between several world powers. Though we will end up fighting nations that once upon a time we may have been able to negotiate with peacefully, we do so in the drive to ensure that peace returns to Europe for good."
  ONU_beachhead_iceland:0 "Beachhead: Iceland"
  ONU_beachhead_iceland_desc:0 "While Iceland is far from the most strategically-important part of Europe or even the North Sea Alliance, it is still an under-defended landmass that would serve as a potential launching point for European operations. This will involve facing the increasingly expansionist North Sea Alliance and its mighty navy, but recent power struggles in Europe may leave their attention divided."
  ONU_secure_the_british_archipelago:0 "Secure The British Archipelago"
  ONU_secure_the_british_archipelago_desc:0 "Great Britain is the heart of the North Sea Alliance. While Ireland is weak and England devastated by civil war, Scotland is still the leading power in the North Sea. Fighting against them will require extensive maritime operations with little room for error, lest our marines end up in a watery grave."
  ONU_unea:0 "UNEA"
  ONU_unea_desc:0 "The United Nations European Administration will be our main administrative body for Europe. While it may evoke memories of the European Union of old in terms of composition, it will represent a Europe more integrated and united than ever."
  ONU_into_scandinavia:0 "Into Scandinavia"
  ONU_into_scandinavia_desc:0 "While Scandinavia is reasonably stable by post-Mistake standards, recent instabilities highlight that no corner of the globe has escaped the catastrophe. The region will need intervention just as any other, as long as we remember to issue winter coats."
  ONU_return_to_geneva:0 "Return To Geneva"
  ONU_return_to_geneva_desc:0 "While Germany is a modern and progressive democracy, its diplomatic relations with us have grown increasingly strained. They have voice considerable opposition to our methods, making it clear that peaceful negotiation will not be an option. But we cannot allow these misguided idealists to stand in our way of bringing lasting peace to the continent, even if it comes at a cost."
  ONU_over_the_eurasian_plain:0 "Over The Eurasian Plain"
  ONU_over_the_eurasian_plain_desc:0 "The Eurasian Union has long been a quagmire of warlords and bandits, ruled over by a militaristic regime with a penchant for strong-arming its neighbors. We will need to intervene to bring order to the chaotic land, and ensure its neighbors are safe from further Eurasian incursions."
  ONU_spread_pan_european_ideals:0 "Spread Pan-European Ideals"
  ONU_spread_pan_european_ideals_desc:0 "Pan-Europeanism has become surprisingly widespread in recent decades, to the point of recent tensions on the continent boiling down to disagreements on what shape a united Europe should take and who gets to call the shots. With Europe becoming united under our banner, it would be wasteful not to lean into these ideals. By leaning into Pan-European rhetoric and recognising the motivating factors behind it, we can help bring the once-divided continent together and heal the divides that once ran through it."
  ONU_to_the_urals:0 "To The Urals"
  ONU_to_the_urals_desc:0 "The anarchic conditions of the Eurasian Union pale in comparison to the Urals. While some semblance of authority returned under the brutal rule of Army Group South, much of the land remains the territory of desperate villages and feral bandits. Our intervention is the land’s only hope for peace."
  ONU_dominate_the_mediterranean:0 "Dominate The Mediterranean"
  ONU_dominate_the_mediterranean_desc:0 "For all its pretensions of democracy, Franco-Iberia has traditionally held very elitist ideals and cared more about culture than the people who inhabit it. It’s not surprising that it has steadfastly denounced our efforts. Unfortunately, we will need to resort to more direct methods to bring their people under our care and prevent its more reactionary elements from posing a threat to the rest of Europe."
  ONU_from_panama_to_patagonia:0 "From Panama To Patagonia"
  ONU_from_panama_to_patagonia_desc:0 "South America is strategically important for a number of reasons. It is connected to our North American heartland by land, allowing for a ground invasion in some capacity. It is home to ecologically critical areas that must be stabilised as soon as possible. But perhaps most of all, almost all of its population live under authoritarianism, militarism, corporatism, or some unholy mix. Our southern neighbors cannot be left to suffer any longer."
  ONU_police_action_in_mexico:0 "Police Action In Mexico"
  ONU_police_action_in_mexico_desc:0 "Having long broken off from the NAU, Mexico remains an independent but increasingly unstable neighbor. Its geographic proximity means that intervention would help secure our position in North America, while allowing us to reach out to aid our most immediate neighbors."
  ONU_urbanize_mexico:0 "Urbanize Mexico"
  ONU_urbanize_mexico_desc:0 "While Mexico’s cities are overcrowded and their services overexerted, encouraging urbanisation would allow us to turn unproductive land into nature preserves and renewable energy projects. However, we must also invest in urban infrastructure to cope with the change, as well as in the local economy to open up new urban workplaces."
  ONU_horizontal_rebuilding_scheme:0 "Horizontal Rebuilding Scheme"
  ONU_horizontal_rebuilding_scheme_desc:0 "Rather than placing even more pressure on Mexico’s overcrowded cities, we should encourage people to move to the country and reverse the decline of rural communities. We’ll need to invest in new transportation infrastructure to facilitate this, as well as roll out programmes to promote sustainable farming projects."
  ONU_occupy_the_caribbean_islands:0 "Occupy The Caribbean Islands"
  ONU_occupy_the_caribbean_islands_desc:0 "Like many island nations, the Caribbean has lost considerable territory to rising sea levels. Bringing them under UNTANA’s wing will put them back on the path to reconstruction. But we must be careful - rumors circulate of a group of hackers known as the Data Angels operating out of Trinidad, and they may pose a risk to our increasingly modern forces."
  ONU_ultimatum_to_central_america:0 "Ultimatum To Central America"
  ONU_ultimatum_to_central_america_desc:0 "The nations of Central America pose little threat to us. Rather than throw away lives and resources on both sides, we should reach out to these nations to negotiate peaceful integration. If they agree, we can focus our efforts on more pressing threats on the South American continent."
  ONU_finalize_the_untana:0 "Finalize The UNTANA"
  ONU_finalize_the_untana_desc:0 "With all of North America under our control, UNTANA finally lives up to its name. We can even bring Central America under its wing, ensuring that they too benefit from our leadership and protection."
  ONU_proceed_south:0 "Proceed South"
  ONU_proceed_south_desc:0 "By securing Central America and the Caribbean, we will have useful staging grounds for an advance into South America by land and by sea. They will also allow us to establish supply lines and logistical hubs closer to the frontlines."
  ONU_break_through_the_andes:0 "Break Through The Andes"
  ONU_break_through_the_andes_desc:0 "The rise of the Andean Compact was an unexpected one, but left the nation a bastion of prosperity and liberty in South America. Unfortunately, while the nation is free and democratic, it has become increasingly dominated by corrupt corporate interests. The Compact and its corporate puppetmasters have shown no indication of joining us willingly, and their lithium reserves are too strategically important for us to pass up on."
  ONU_work_with_compact_loyalists:0 "Work With The Compact Loyalists"
  ONU_work_with_compact_loyalists_desc:0 "While far from a perfect society, the Andean Compact shared many of the values that we treasure. Though the usual nationalist sentiments are flaring up in response to the nation’s integration, some former politicians and business leaders are proving unusually cooperative. Encouraging closer ties and a few special deals will leave the Andes in a respectable position in the UN, not to mention a wealthy one."
  ONU_internationalize_lithium_deposits:0 "Internationalize Lithium Deposits"
  ONU_internationalize_lithium_deposits_desc:0 "Lithium is an increasingly rare and increasingly valuable resource, used in critical industrial processes and the manufacture of batteries. Instead of selling these stockpiles off to the highest bidder, we should take steps to ensure that these limited supplies are utilised as equitably as possible."
  ONU_land_in_bolivaria:0 "Land In Bolivaria"
  ONU_land_in_bolivaria_desc:0 "The United Bolivarian Republic has long been an oddity of South American politics - a secluded junta living in perpetual fear of a North American invasion. Unfortunately for them, it looks like their worst fears are about to be realised. But it is a necessary step to free the nation’s people from the chains of isolationism and militarism."
  ONU_prepare_southern_infrastructure:0 "Prepare Southern Infrastructure"
  ONU_prepare_southern_infrastructure_desc:0 "Due to its isolationist period, much of Bolivaria has remained undeveloped even by modern standards. While there is little we can do at the moment, we can at least begin to overhaul its energy, industrial and transportation sectors in preparation for future development."
  ONU_anti_totalitarianism_campaign:0 "Anti-Totalitarianism Campaign"
  ONU_anti_totalitarianism_campaign_desc:0 "Many in South America are surprised to learn that we remain committed to our democratic ideals. While there is some obvious hypocrisy there as we unify the world by force, we must make it clear that we condone totalitarian rule. Through propaganda and educational campaigns, we will lay the foundation for democracy to return to South America once more."
  ONU_enter_brazil:0 "Enter Brazil"
  ONU_enter_brazil_desc:0 "We are going to Brazil: a nation that has not only been wracked by violence and unrest since before the Great Mistake, but holds most of what precious little remains of the Amazonian Rainforest. Stabilising the ecological situation in the region will be just as vital as restoring peace."
  ONU_saesb:0 "SAESB"
  ONU_saesb_desc:0 "The South American Ecological Services Board is an oddity among our planned regional administrations. While we are obviously committed to protecting the people of South America, the restoration of the Amazonian Rainforest is also a strategic ecological priority. Any chance of even halting - let alone reversing - Earth’s decline will depend upon South America, but we are not about to ignore its people."
  ONU_eradicate_militarism:0 "Eradicate Militarism"
  ONU_eradicate_militarism_desc:0 "Once again, our work to bring peace to the world through force leads to confusion, with many believing that we are far more militaristic than we truly are. We must make it clearer that we fight only as a last resort in a desperate bid to save humanity, ultimately in the hopes of bringing and preserving peace. Though with so many in South America used to militarism, we can at least direct them to the nearest recruiting office so that they may be of use."
  ONU_pacify_the_amazon:0 "Pacify The Amazon"
  ONU_pacify_the_amazon_desc:0 "As precious as the Amazon is to conservation efforts, it’s also the perfect hiding spot for rebels and holdouts. Considering that our troops’ experience fighting in rainforests is limited, it’s going to be a trial by fire in jungle warfare as well as counter-insurgency. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t train them in a few measures that might save their lives."
  ONU_mobilize_against_la_plata:0 "Mobilize Against La Plata"
  ONU_mobilize_against_la_plata_desc:0 "Our work in South America has been difficult, but the continent nears unity. With one last push to the south, we can bring the last of its people under our protection."
  ONU_permit_civilian_rule:0 "Permit Civilian Rule"
  ONU_permit_civilian_rule_desc:0 "Much like in North America, we will need to demonstrate our commitment to democracy. Returning once-militarised areas to democratic civilian governance is a good first step."
  ONU_prepare_atlantic_dockyards:0 "Prepare Atlantic Dockyards"
  ONU_prepare_atlantic_dockyards_desc:0 "With Europe and Africa lying directly across the Atlantic ocean, we should further build up our naval capacity. Investing in South America’s shipbuilding industry will allow us to rapidly increase our fleet size, and produce some local jobs in the process."
  ONU_combine_south_american_nations:0 "Combine South American Nations"
  ONU_combine_south_american_nations_desc:0 "Bringing the last of South America under the SAESB leaves the continent united under our banner. We can now turn our eyes to once-militarised nations like Brazil and Bolivaria, whose militaries will make great additions to our own."
  ONU_across_the_sahara:0 "Across The Sahara"
  ONU_across_the_sahara_desc:0 "Africa has grown into an increasingly divided continent, both politically and economically. While it is home to world powers such as the East African Federation, other parts of the continent remain impoverished and chaotic. We must intervene to stabilise these areas, but not all will welcome our involvement."
  ONU_landings_in_morocco:0 "Landings In Morocco"
  ONU_landings_in_morocco_desc:0 "UNSTRATCOM has the identified the northwest African coast as our best choice of landing grounds, given its comparative proximity to UNTANA. Further focusing on North Africa will secure a footing on the continent, allowing a ground push south backed by naval deployment to the coasts."
  ONU_form_north_african_offices:0 "Form North African Offices"
  ONU_form_north_african_offices_desc:0 "Africa is a land made up of many nations with even more ethnic and local groups within them. Bringing them together will be a difficult task politically, meaning we cannot wait until we have secured control of the continent to begin the process. Establishing initial administrative sectors in North Africa will be a good start at unification, and will help bolster local support in the process."
  ONU_against_the_mediterranean:0 "Against The Mediterranean"
  ONU_against_the_mediterranean_desc:0 "Securing the Mediterranean has additionally been highlighted as a strategic priority, in order to secure oceanic routes for our operations in North Africa and Europe. However, Franco-Iberia’s influence in the region is strong. Not only will we risk drawing their ire, but local forces may be equipped with modern Franco-Iberian imports."
  ONU_pacify_egypt:0 "Pacify Egypt"
  ONU_pacify_egypt_desc:0 "Egypt is without a doubt the toughest challenge facing us in North Africa. But with the nation facing tremendous upheaval from the flooding of the Nile River, our intervention is a necessity to address the humanitarian crisis brewing there."
  ONU_tap_the_niles_power:0 "Tap The Nile's Power"
  ONU_tap_the_niles_power_desc:0 "Despite the impacts of climate change, the Nile remains among the world’s mightiest rivers. Building up hydroelectric power infrastructure will not only help power development efforts in North Africa, but with proper planning we can also reduce the risk of flooding in the process."
  ONU_landings_in_south_africa:0 "Landings In South Africa"
  ONU_landings_in_south_africa_desc:0 "By launching additional marine landings in South Africa, we can secure an additional foothold on the continent and put pressure on our opponents from both the north and the south."
  ONU_pacify_the_congo:0 "Pacify The Congo"
  ONU_pacify_the_congo_desc:0 "The Congo is proving fierce in its desire to remain ‘free’. They fail to realise that true freedom will come as part of our stable and growing international community, not by fighting over scraps of ravaged lands."
  ONU_a_meeting_in_sudan:0 "A Meeting In Sudan"
  ONU_a_meeting_in_sudan_desc:0 "The East African Federation will not go down without a considerable fight. Considering that their values align with our own in many ways, we will approach them with the option to peacefully join us and avoid wracking the continent with further bloodshed. The proposed Sudan Conference will also allow smaller nations to make their voices heard as well, with similar offers for them on the table."
  ONU_into_the_west:0 "Into The West"
  ONU_into_the_west_desc:0 "With our control of the continent growing more secure by the day, the nations of West Africa are next to be integrated. Having missed out on the stability and prosperity seen in the EAF, many of their citizens will welcome our peacekeepers."
  ONU_facilitate_international_trade:0 "Facilitate International Trade"
  ONU_facilitate_international_trade_desc:0 "Boosting the African economy will the first step in developing its communities. Encouraging trade between our member nations will help get the wheels turning, and hopefully pave over past differences."
  ONU_integrate_african_labs:0 "Integrate African Labs"
  ONU_integrate_african_labs_desc:0 "The East African Federation was an emerging world power, and a major contributor to scientific knowledge. Adding their research capabilities to our own will provide sizeable boosts to our scientific endeavours, not to mention great strides in the advancement of human knowledge."
  ONU_create_african_governorships:0 "Create African Governorships"
  ONU_create_african_governorships_desc:0 "In order to help bolster support among African communities, we will establish local governorships explicitly aimed at ensuring that local voices have a say in regional governance."
  ONU_combine_african_nations:0 "Combine African Nations"
  ONU_combine_african_nations_desc:0 "With the African continent secure, the way is clear for the the United Nations Pan-African Administration to be established. However, despite our efforts to promote unity, it will take time for long-held hostilities between nations (not to mention against us) to fade. We will need additional peacekeeping forces to remain in Africa for some time in order to intervene when these hostilities boil over."
  ONU_appropriate_pan_africanism:0 "Appropriate Pan-Africanism"
  ONU_appropriate_pan_africanism_desc:0 "Pan-Africanism is an ideology primarily pushed by the East African Federation, but it has found its supporters in other nations as well. Disagreements abound over the hows and whys, but that’s not entirely to our inconvenience. By incorporating Pan-African messages tailored to local audiences, we can shore up support among Africa’s local populations."
  ONU_stabilize_ethiopia:0 "Stabilize Ethiopia"
  ONU_stabilize_ethiopia_desc:0 "With the recent civil war in Ethiopia, the situation grows direr by the day. In order to secure inroads for humanitarian aid to its suffering populace, we will need to move in and bring some semblance of stability."
  ONU_somalian_intervention:0 "Somalian Intervention"
  ONU_somalian_intervention_desc:0 "Somalia has long been wracked by unrest and instability, even long before the Great Mistake. Its people are long overdue for a reprieve. Under our guidance, they may finally know peace and prosperity."
  ONU_reconnect_the_continent:0 "Reconnect The Continent"
  ONU_reconnect_the_continent_desc:0 "Much of Africa’s transportation infrastructure has decayed since the Great Mistake, and in many cases wasn’t in great shape before it. Recent conflict will only have done further damage, making restoration a top priority. But rather than just repairing these systems, we must also begin to expand them, bringing the continent closer together and facilitating trade."
  ONU_prepare_indian_transports:0 "Prepare Indian Transports"
  ONU_prepare_indian_transports_desc:0 "Our long-awaited intervention in India will be challenging in many ways, not least of all logistical. Preparing naval transports for marines and supplies must be a top priority before a single boot touches Indian soil."
  ONU_police_action_in_the_middle_east:0 "Police Action In The Middle East"
  ONU_police_action_in_the_middle_east_desc:0 "The Middle East remains a quagmire of warring nations and tribes, ravaged by climate change, mass migration and perpetual conflict. Bringing peace to the region will be exceptionally difficult, but we owe it to the suffering people of the area to try."
  ONU_unmea:0 "UNMEA"
  ONU_unmea_desc:0 "The United Nations Middle Eastern Administration represents one of our greatest successes so far: united the volatile region under a single banner. Unfortunately, while many have welcomed our involvement in the area, it will be a very long time before the various partisans and terrorists resisting the UNMEA will be rooted out. We will need to dedicate additional troops to the region to clear out the larger groups, such as the Crescent Guard, the Iranian Reclamation Front and the Global Liberation Army."
  ONU_ultimatum_to_central_asia:0 "Ultimatum To Central Asia"
  ONU_ultimatum_to_central_asia_desc:0 "The Central Asian Federation is a beacon of democracy and modernity, having emerged as something of a dark horse following the Great Mistake. Going to war with a nation that encapsulates our ideals so closely would be a great shame, so we should approach them with an offer to head off potential bloodshed."
  ONU_unite_the_oceans:0 "Unite The Oceans"
  ONU_unite_the_oceans_desc:0 "The United Nations Southeast Asia and Oceania Administration will govern much of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from former Australasia and Nusantara across much of mainland Asia south of China. With our operations in Central Asia complete, we can spare some troops to ensure the transition of power goes smoothly."
  ONU_pacify_india:0 "Pacify India"
  ONU_pacify_india_desc:0 "India was ground zero of the Great Mistake, and never fully recovered. The once-proud nation has become a wasteland beset by violence and poverty, with even Thakur’s admirable efforts at unification proving inadequate at containing the degradation. Rebuilding the nation will be our greatest humanitarian challenge yet, but before we can even consider it we will need to clear out the petty warlords who have claimed chunks of the subcontinent as their territory."
  ONU_the_religions_debate:0 "The Religions Debate"
  ONU_the_religions_debate_desc:0 "Moving into deeply religious areas such as India and the Middle East raises some deeply important questions about how we approach religion. While the UN is a secular organisation that supports religious freedoms, we are increasingly coming to represent people from faiths all across the globe, and in many cases no formal religion or spiritual belief at all. We must re-examine our stance on religion and determine if it some adjustment is in order."
  ONU_unia:0 "UNIA"
  ONU_unia_desc:0 "Under our guidance, peace is already returning to the Indian Subcontinent. Under the United Nations Indian Administration, this will only continue. It won’t be an easy process, however. Parts of India have simply not recovered from the Great Mistake, remaining impoverished or in outright anarchy. Blue helmets will be a common sight in those areas for a long time to come."
  ONU_ungmra:0 "UNGMRA"
  ONU_ungmra_desc:0 "Since our days establishing ourselves in North America, we have been hard at work rebuilding from the Great Mistake. It was never going to be an easy task, and even our best efforts have proven patchwork at best. That is why we need to vastly overhaul the United Nations Great Mistake Reconstruction Agency - our principal organ dedicated solely to reversing the damage of the Great Mistake. With its expanded jurisdiction, it will coordinate a global ecological, economic and political response to the Great Mistake, doing everything humanly possible to reverse the effects and prevent further decline. It is an endeavour that may take generations, but it is increasingly one that we are undertaking as a united species."
  ONU_in_the_pacific:0 "In The Pacific"
  ONU_in_the_pacific_desc:0 "The Pacific was hit hard by the Great Mistake, losing many cities and a lot of infrastructure to the waves. While remarkable progress has been made in recovering, these measures are reaching their limits and cracks in the Pacific order are growing. All the while, the shadow of China looms large, and increasingly more people living under it grow discontent with its rule."
  ONU_beachhead_in_new_zealand:0 "Beachhead In New Zealand"
  ONU_beachhead_in_new_zealand_desc:0 "New Zealand is overlooked even in the Federation of Australasia, very much being a junior partner. Not only can we bring much-needed aid to its shores, but its geographic position makes it a perfect launching point for an invasion of the much more strategically important Australian mainland."
  ONU_modern_island_hopping:0 "Modern Island Hopping"
  ONU_modern_island_hopping_desc:0 "Our intervention in the Pacific increasingly involves rapid movement between islands, which is putting our navy and its crews to the test. UNTACCOM has compiled a list of proposed improvements to our designs and processes, which would greatly expedite our naval operations."
  ONU_pacify_australia:0 "Pacify Australia"
  ONU_pacify_australia_desc:0 "While Australia is the heart of Australasia, it is still a hot and dry nation that has only become hotter and drier since the Great Mistake. Liberating it will require careful consideration to the effects of heat exhaustion even in developed areas. Our forces deployed further inland will have it even harder, and will need to conserve water in the parched outback."
  ONU_the_nusantaran_connection:0 "The Nusantaran Connection"
  ONU_the_nusantaran_connection_desc:0 "Despite the Pacific being hit hardest by rising sea levels, Nusantara is something of a rising power in the region. It has quickly closed the gap with Australasia, though it’s not without its own internal conflicts. Still, with so many communities forced from their traditional homelands by the rising tides, intervention in the area is an urgent necessity to help them get back on their feet."
  ONU_airbase_development:0 "Airbase Development"
  ONU_airbase_development_desc:0 "In order to relieve the pressure of island-hopping on our fleets, we should make a concentrated effort to build up our air force’s ability to keep up. Not only must we improve our ability to refurbish captured airfields, but we must also allocate resources to building new ones."
  ONU_the_indochina_question:0 "The Indochina Question"
  ONU_the_indochina_question_desc:0 "Mainland Asia is very much China’s sphere of influence, with the nations there having turned north in the face of rising oceans and escalating refugee crises. These same issues wrack the area to this day, and we must act to free its people from the incompetence of their pro-China leaders."
  ONU_resolve_the_burmese_issue:0 "Resolve The Burmese Issue"
  ONU_resolve_the_burmese_issue_desc:0 "While China’s influence is lower in the west of mainland Asia, this only means it is more unstable. If we are to bring order to Asia, Burma and its surrounding nations will be our next area of operations."
  ONU_ultimatum_to_japan:0 "Ultimatum To Japan"
  ONU_ultimatum_to_japan_desc:0 "Japan is a highly modern nation that - despite its island nature - has managed to survive the Great Mistake in a very good position economically and technologically. While this is thanks in no small part to its underregulated corporate sector, we cannot ignore that the country is still a shining example of freedom and democracy in the region. We may even be able to convince them to join us peacefully, with the right concessions on the table."
  ONU_police_action_in_china:0 "Police Action In China"
  ONU_police_action_in_china_desc:0 "The People’s Republic of China survived the Great Mistake to become the world’s sole remaining superpower. And yet, it continues to oppress its people under totalitarian rule, and has strongarmed its neighbours into its sphere of influence. While the country has been weakened by civil conflict, the people of China still call out for their freedom both in their homeland and in the frozen wastes of Siberia. We have heard their cries and will answer, but it will not be an easy fight for us."
  ONU_unca:0 "UNCA"
  ONU_unca_desc:0 "The United Nations Chinese Administration will, obviously, be our administrative branch for China. However, it will also cover the former Chinese-led Chita-Nurgan Republic, in addition to the increasingly Chinese-majority Siberia. These areas have known considerable civil and ethnic clashes over recent years, and we will need to allocate additional personnel to keep the peace."
  ONU_end_the_ideological_disputes:0 "End The Ideological Disputes"
  ONU_end_the_ideological_disputes_desc:0 "Despite its status as a superpower, China has recently undergone a civil war over deeply conflicting ideologies, which continue to be a flashpoint of tensions within the UNCA. While we may be forced to clamp down on some of the more authoritarian and militant elements, paying lip service to the more palatable ideologies may help placate some of the idealogues."
  ONU_tying_loose_ends:0 "Tying Loose Ends"
  ONU_tying_loose_ends_desc:0 "It’s not surprising that rogue units of the People’s Liberation Army and various secessionist forces remain in China. By working with newly-integrated forces in China, we can not only crack down on these rebels, but help identify nationalistic elements in our own ranks in the process."
  ONU_asian_superhighway_developmental_funds:0 "Asian Superhighway Developmental  Funds"
  ONU_asian_superhighway_developmental_funds_desc:0 "Asia’s transportation networks have been severely damaged by the recent Chinese Civil War and our own Unification Conflict. As a show of goodwill to the locals, we will not only repair the damage to the networks, but invest in their expansion."
