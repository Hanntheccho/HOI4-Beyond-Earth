  un_event.1.t: "Buffalo Falls"
  un_event.1.d: "It took less than a week for the ARC Oversight Board to be overthrown. It might have taken longer if half the Board wasn’t on vacation.\n\nPravin Lal peered from the ancient APC’s firing port as the convoy it led rolled into Buffalo. The city had already been taken in the largest police action the UN had engaged in since the Dark Days, backed by citizen uprisings against the much-loathed Oversight Board and its PMC enforcers. Their abuses of the population were widely known, from withholding food and water as a means of leverage to turning a blind eye to raider activity. The UN had filled the gaps left by the Board, ingratiating themselves to much of District 3’s population in the process. Few would be mourning the Board’s overthrow.\n\nAs he eyed the littered streets and buildings peppered by bullet holes new and old, Lal listened in to the latest tactical report on the radio. The 45th ARC Peacekeeping Division was still retreating north after being routed at Syracuse, while the 68th remained encircled by UN forces at Pittsburgh. That left the bulk of ARC forces in District 3 out of the fight. The token NAU garrison in Buffalo certainly hadn’t held out long, what with District 3 being a punitive posting for problem soldiers. That still left huge numbers of NAU and ARC forces elsewhere in North America, but subsequent reports of uprisings and civil conflict across the NAU meant that the UN was far from the top of anyone’s priority list.\n\nThe convoy soon reached ARC’s local headquarters, which resembled a country club more than an administrative center. As far as Lal was concerned, no government building had need of a golf course. But the green was already filling up with tents and parked vehicles as the UN began to move in. Once they’d seized control of ARC’s administrative systems, command of the district would theirs. \n\nLal almost dared not hope that they accomplish much more. Holding onto it would be difficult, and seizing more territory an uphill battle. But what did they have to lose? Wait until the ARC or NAU finally decided to flush them out? Sit in the flooded ruins of the East Coast and wither away into nothingness as Earth died around them? No. They had a chance of bringing peace and stability to the world, and would die for their ideals if they had to."
  un_event_option.1.a: "For even if they failed, the world would be lost anyway."
  un_event.2.t: "Election Night"
  un_event.2.d: "Pravin Lal was to remain Secretary-General.\n\nFor the first time in more than a century, the people of America had made their voices heard. Lal’s popularity had assured his election, so the results came as no surprise. But he was oddly relieved to see some of the other candidates doing better than projected. If nothing else, it would prove that the process wasn’t rigged.\n\nA datalink livefeed streamed the results to his office, where he’d excused himself away from the celebrations across Central City to gather his thoughts. He peered closer at the monitor, seeing the latest figures for his competitors. Most were fellow UN loyalists who’d run against him on platforms with differing visions for the UN’s future. But there were a few vestiges of America’s recent past among the minor candidates. A Christian Democrat in the south. A libertarian in the Midwest. Even a ‘democratic stratocrat’ in California. Their vote shares were even smaller than his UN competitors, but they were still a definite presence.\n\nThe UN would never be rid of such remnants. The constant stream of reports of partisan activity attested to that; earlier in the night, a group of Blue Helmets had been drawn into a gunfight with suspected NAU loyalists attempting to engage in voter intimidation in the Great Lakes. He’d hoped that offering a peaceful avenue for dissenting ideals would calm things down, but he dreaded to imagine what discontent might brew among the losing sides in the coming days.\n\nBut he did his best to remind himself of that day’s triumph. Democracy had returned to America, and a new election successfully held. Turning his chair around, Lal sat watching the fireworks for a while, their blue colors cascading high above the city."
  un_event_option.2.a: "He liked to think that, somewhere up there, Pria was smiling down on him."
  un_event.3.t: "The Inevitable"
  un_event.3.d: "With each new passing day, Lal’s worst fears became more and more manifest.\n\nOne of the first things he’d done upon his formal election was to reach out to world leaders, inviting them into the UN’s fold. The responses (where there had been any) had been mixed. Many were openly skeptical of the UN’s intentions, questioning its legitimacy following the defeat of the NAU and the remnants of the USA. Others were doubtful about the UN’s capabilities, pointing out that the organisation had failed to prevent the Great Mistake or wider ecological crisis. Few were genuinely interested beyond lip service, making it clear that they expected their national sovereignty to be respected.\n\nThere was an unmistakable sense that time was running out. The daily briefings drew on longer than ever, filled with reports of civil conflict and natural disaster across the globe. It was increasingly clear that fragmented nation-states were no longer capable of dealing with the crises facing Earth and humanity. Failure to reverse the decline could very well see a catastrophe that dwarfed the Great Mistake. Considering how narrowly civilization had survived that, there was little reason to expect it to happen again.\n\nLal took a few deep breaths, turning away from the monitors and holographic displays crowding his desk. Down in the courtyard below his window, the newest generation of Blue Helmets were doing a dress rehearsal of the following day’s graduation ceremony. It was to be a much bigger event than past graduations, seeing as the Blue Helmets were now a modern fighting force. There’d been no doubt in Lal’s mind that those same peacekeepers would end up fighting for control of other nations - a confronting idea, regardless of how noble the UN’s intentions may be."
  un_event_option.3.a: "But deep down, Lal knew that there was no other way."
  un_event.4.t: "The Augmentation Debate"
  un_event.4.d: "While prosthetics are a widely-utilised medical technology, we are increasingly able to utilise cybernetic and genetic augmentations that easily exceed the capacity of a baseline human. Due to the prohibitive costs, very few people have traditionally had access to such augmentations outside of those close to governments and corporations. However, as these technologies become more affordable, it is becoming less and less infrequent to see them in public. Not all believe this to be a good thing.\n\nAugmentation technologies risk creating or cementing inequalities, with augmented workers often being capable of much more intensive work than their unaugmented colleagues. Proliferation of the technology also increases the risk that they wind up utilised by criminals or the mentally unstable, not helped by the additional risk of black market augmentations and back-alley clinics producing fault augments. The theological arguments against vary between denominations, but all voice trepidation that an overreliance on augmentation runs the risk of people losing their humanity.\n\nConversely, it has been argued that the intensive requirements of post-Mistake recovery means that augmented workers are in urgent demand, with the benefits of their work flowing to the augmented and unaugmented alike. Militarily, augmented troops could do their jobs more effectively, potentially lowering collateral damage. Some have even suggested that humanity’s situation has been so thoroughly disrupted by the Great Mistake that augmentation technology is a necessary step to survive a world teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nAs we look to bring the world under our banner, our approach to augmentation may well have global implications. Considering the risks posed by augmentation, and the potential it holds for humanity, is it something that we should embrace?"
  un_event_option.4.a: "Augmentations shall be strictly regulated outside of vital medical and military applications."
  un_event_option.4.b: "Augmentations shall be fairly regulated like any other dangerous technology."
  un_event_option.4.c: "Augmentations shall be subsidized where it is in the public interest."
  un_event.5.t: "The AI Debate"
  un_event.5.d: "Artificial Intelligence is nothing new, having been used in industry, commerce and even entertainment since the late 20th century. Technological recesses following the Great Mistake have set AI development back, but in some pockets the field has reached unprecedented heights. With these recent advancements in AI, we must consider whether their potential benefits and hazards.\n\nEconomies are still largely in very dire straits following the Great Mistake, with widespread unemployment often a serious issue. Automating even more work processes would only worsen the situation, bringing the economy grinding to a halt with reduced consumer activity. And that’s not counting the risk of a superintelligent AI deciding that humanity poses an existential risk to itself, and moving to wipe us out. In fact, a ‘dumb’ AI of sufficient capability may inadvertently cause a similar outcome. If we assign an AI to calculate the digits of Pi, it may take over our machines, kill us for our resources, and turn the entire planet into a gigantic supercomputer to do calculate Pi exactly as it assigned to do.\n\nOf course, this is a worst-case scenario. AI still has a lot to offer with careful regulation. Rather than replace workers, it could make them much more efficient and versatile by supporting them instead. Advances in research processes would be immensely useful as well, able to produce highly accurate simulations to test hypotheses in any number of fields. AI can also have military applications, from autonomous platforms reducing the need for soldiers risking their lives through to sophisticated training programs that give human soldiers even better training to help them survive.\n\nWith the world in its current state, it doesn’t look like a robot war or post-scarcity utopia is happening any time soon. But even in the short term, AI stands to cause great disruption, and we must decide how the UN will approach it moving forward."
  un_event_option.5.a: "Advanced Artificial Intelligence will be banned completely."
  un_event_option.5.b: "Advanced Artificial Intelligence will be regulated extremely tightly."
  un_event_option.5.c: "Advanced Artificial Intelligence will be fairly regulated."
  un_event.6.t: "In the Past"
  un_event.6.d: "For all the changes that had come to Europe, one small part was practically frozen in time.\n\nThe United Nations Office at Geneva had once been home to one of the main administrative centers of the old UN, primarily based in the Palace of Nations building originally intended for the League of Nations. There was a bitter irony that the UN met the same fate as its predecessor, falling apart after a devastating war it failed to prevent. And not long after, the building had been refurbished into the UN Museum at Geneva.\n\nPravin Lal walked its halls with a sense of wonder he hadn’t felt since he was a boy. Most of the exhibits showed parts of the UN’s past that he knew well enough, but there were so many gaps in their records that were filled by the knowledge on display. The photographs alone were like peering into the past. There were images of conflicts forgotten about long ago, where peacekeepers donned their distinctive helmets to bring peace. There were images of disasters that paled next to the Great Mistake, where relief efforts had flowed nonetheless. There images of politicians and activists of all stripes smiling at the cameras, blissfully oblivious to the fate of their world looming mere decades later.\n\n‘This is a truly incredible collection, Herr Dorn,’ Lal said, walking along beside the curator. “I’ll have UNESCO reach out to you as soon as possible to provide funding. More than the German Federation ever gave you. We should be able to arrange some more recent pieces for you to display, too.’\n\nThe older man nodded, expression still stunned. He’d almost collapsed in surprise when Lal and his Blue Helmet escort had turned up asking for a tour. ‘Danke, Herr Lal. I… I never expected to see this day. Don’t get me wrong, I stand by so much of what the UN believes in. A lot of INTEGR supporters do. But we thought you all long gone. Having you come swooping in out of nowhere, and so forcefully…’\n\nLal sighed. ‘I take no pride in having to use force. Believe me. But the world needs us. More than it realises.’\n\n“I understand, Herr Lal. But I do ask one favor of you. When UNESCO comes in and begins funding us, allow us to record your history as it truly is. No glorifying the Unification Conflict. No denial of its cost. Just objective fact, leaving future generations free to judge you as they see fit.’\n\nIt was that last line that gave Lal pause. Many people had died from his actions, and even more were to follow. Not a day went by without it weighing on him. And yet, compared to the suffering that he stood to alleviate, he could still see it all being necessary. Unforgivable, perhaps, but necessary."
  un_event_option.6.a: "‘Of course, Herr Dorn. I wouldn’t have it any other way.’"
  un_event.7.t: "In the Rainforest"
  un_event.7.d: "Pravin Lal was no woodsman, but he’d spent his fair share of time in the wilderness. Nature had reclaimed so much of District 3 since the great Post-Mistake exodus from the coasts. From overgrown towns to resurgent forests, Lal liked to think he knew nature’s beauty fairly well. And yet it all paled compared to the Amazonian Rainforest.\n\nA lot of it was clearly in very sorry state. Even flying out to the parts that remained took him over many slash-cut wastelands and monoculture factory farms. But as he’d left his plane, he was met by the sight of more wild greenery than he’d ever seen, lying wild and untamed beyond the airstrip’s perimeter. A small group had assembled at the runway to meet him and his entourage - mostly local Yanomami tribespeople, and a few Lamentadores who had gone native after the Brazilian Civil War. The Blue Helmets escorting him kept the guerillas in their sights, but they quickly proved just as friendly as the locals.\n\n‘Welcome to the Amazon, Senhor Lal,’ said a Yanomami woman wearing a camouflage outfit bearing a makeshift Lamentadore shoulder patch. ‘I’m Yarima. Didn’t bring your jornalistas?’\n\nLal shook the woman’s hand politely, but still tilted his head slightly. ‘My journalists?’\n\n‘Sim. Your contact said you wanted to come out here for a tour, and needed a guide. I figured it was just for the publicity.’\n\n‘No. I just want to examine conditions on the ground in the rainforest. Especially for the tribes. No jornalistas. No políticos. Just the truth.’\n\nYarima nodded, a ghost of a smile crossing her lips. ‘I can respect that. You might not like what you see, though. A lot of the rainforest’s wasteland now, and’ll take years to recover. Not to mention the people. So many forced from their land, so many hurt by the war…’\n\n‘Civil or Unification?’\n\n‘Both. I heard a lot of things about you, Lal. Some very good. Some very, very bad. But if you care to hear us out, you’re alright in my books.’\n\nLooking around at the faces around him, from the appraising guerillas to the curious children, Lal could only nod in acknowledgement of Yarima’s words. A lot of change was coming to South America, and he knew full well that he couldn’t lose sight of its people."
  un_event_option.7.a: "They were making history, but couldn’t afford to repeat it."
  un_event.8.t: "To Love Her Again"
  un_event.8.d: "Doctor Usian sat silently as he listened to Lal’s request. Around them was the most sophisticated laboratory had seen, truly the cutting edge of the former East African Federation. If there was anywhere Pravin’s dream could come true, it would be there.\n\n‘I cannot help you, Secretary General,’ Usian said plainly.\n\n‘Cannot, or will not?’\n\n‘Both. You ask me to make a clone of your wife. We cannot make an adult clone. I will not make a child for you to marry when she reaches adulthood. That leaves a choice between the impossible and the unethical.’\n\n‘Of course,’ Lal replied, too disgusted with himself to say more. It had been a foolish idea from the start.\n\nUsian regarded him silently for a moment, before wheeling his chair closer and placing a hand on Lal’s shoulder. ‘Secretary General… Pravin… I understand why you want this. You have my deepest sympathies for the death of your wife. She sounds like she was a truly selfless, remarkable woman. But she wouldn’t want this.’ \n\nLal took a deep breath, composing himself. ‘Of course. Just… can you preserve the sample? Find another use for it?’\n\nNodding, Usian patted the refrigerated container on the desk beside them. ‘That, I can do. Even in death, she will further the cause of medicine. You have my word.’"
  un_event_option.8.a: "As he lay in bed that night, Lal couldn’t shake the feeling that he had witnessed a form of transcendence."
  un_event.9.t: "The Religions Debate"
  un_event.9.d: "There’s no denying that spirituality has long been an important part of the human condition for many people. From pagan rituals to worldwide religions, it has left tremendous mark on cultures across the world. But as the UN’s reforged international community grows ever more diverse, we must consider the role it is going to play in our ranks.\n\nThere’s no denying it’s already here. Through the darkest days of our exile in District 3, faith kept many hopeful when it would have been easier to give in to despair or walk away. To others, it is the very thing that drives them to be selfless, driven by a belief that we are all children of the same deity. The same behaviors can be seen all over the world, from Thakur’s efforts bring a degree of order in India to the charitable accomplishments of the New Papacy in South America.\n\nOf course, we can’t deny that religion isn’t without its flaws. Violence, discrimination and anti-intellectualism have long been associated with religion, along with good old-fashioned hypocrisy. Many people are simply not religious at all, which is rarely viewed favorably by the deeply devout. Nor do differing religions always get along, to put it lightly.\n\nWe must be cautious to avoid too much generalisation with religion. It is a complicated topic, just like the complicated people who embrace or forgo it. But as we come to encompass more and more of the world’s faiths, sooner or later we will need to examine whether our present approach is suited to the challenge. Bringing unity is difficult enough in the physical world, but the metaphysical is another matter entirely."
  un_event_option.9.a: "We will introduce measures to more firmly enforce separation of religion and politics."
  un_event_option.9.b: "We will maintain our current secular approach to governance while retaining a commitment to freedom of religion."
  un_event_option.9.c: "We will more openly encourage people to practice and respectfully teach others about their faith, but still work to prevent extremism and discrimination."
  un_event.10.t: "In the Capital"
  un_event.10.d: "There was something off about Beijing.\n\nPravin Lal wasn’t such a country bumpkin that he felt uncomfortable in a city. Even before the UN had established itself in Central City, he’d spent years living and studying in the human anthill that was Arcopolis. But Beijing was different. It was developed and stable even by 21st century standards. That might have been it - a certain uncanniness from a city that lacked obvious scars from the Great Mistake. China had adapted very well, enough to survive as a superpower. At least until it fell apart from within.\n\nThe tensions of the Second Chinese Civil War weren’t going anywhere. Two days prior, an anti-UN protest turned violent as pro-communist demonstrators were attacked by a group of ultranationalists. An attempt to intervene by the Blue Helmets only led to a three-way altercation, in which two locals were killed and more than a dozen more injured. More protests had ensued the following day. The Blue Helmets had upped their presence in the streets, but Lal wasn’t happy to see it.\n\nThe incident had soured any sense of triumph he should have been feeling. The UN had won out against China, the world’s sole remaining superpower. That was a momentous achievement, which suddenly made the prospect of global unification all the more possible. But it only saw the same galvanisation of the population, with tremendous opposition right off the bat. Sure, there were plenty who were prepared to cooperate as long as they received some concessions. The ideological loyalty of the average citizen of the 23rd century often extended as far as who would offer them food, water and safety. Or at least that was the case in so many other places.\n\nHow long would it take for things to calm down? Would the UN still be facing protests about the Unification War in the coming decades? Or would it escalate to open rebellion by that point? Uniting humanity was already a herculean task, but governing it would be harder still. Not only that, but it would be a struggle that would likely go on indefinitely. There were a lot of very talented people in its growing ranks, and he could only hope they were up to the task."
  un_event_option.10.a: "Lal sat by his window, grappling with his thoughts as he stared down into Tiananmen Square."
  un_event.11.t: "In the Ruins"
  un_event.11.d: "The Earth’s Gaping Wound, they called it. The once-vibrant region of Punjab, reduced to wasteland by nuclear fire and anarchy by barbaric army defectors, was Ground Zero of the Great Mistake. It had also seen some of the fiercest fighting in the UN’s efforts to bring order to the subcontinent. Even so, Lal braved the ostensibly-secured region to witness the worst of the Great Mistake for himself. His convoy distributed aid each time they stopped, but it was clear many locals saw the Blue Helmets as just another warlord moving in by force.\n\nThe convoy was camped by the road to Amritsar when the Blue Helmets caught a boy trying to steal a battery from one of the  rovers. They’d had no trouble hauling him before Lal - the lad was barely ten years old, all skin and bones. He offered no resistance, and his eyes held an emptiness no child’s eyes should hold. Lal said knelt down before him, addressing him in rusty Punjabi. ‘The batteries sell well? They get you food for a long time?’\n\nThe boy stared at him for a moment, before giving a small nod.\n\n‘Looks like you could use it. Do you have family? Parents?’\n\nThe boy shook his head. ‘Dead. Sons of Shiva.’\n\n‘I’m sorry. My wife died many years ago, and I miss her still. I know how you feel. It doesn’t get easier, does it?’\n\n‘No,’ the boy whispered. ‘Miss them.’\n\nLal sighed, rising to his feet. ‘We’ve got some food in the trucks. You’re welcome to take some with you. You’re just as welcome to come with us. We can find you a better place to live than this. Won’t have to steal a single battery.’\n\nThe boy smirked, but followed along willingly enough. Lal suspected he was going to take his food and bolt, but young Sukhbir surprised him. His initial skittishness faded with a full stomach, ultimately accompanying Lal to Amritsar and the ruins of the Golden Temple. A group of Sikhs had already begun rebuilding with UNESCO’s support and UNIA-TACCOM’s protection. There was little of value left to salvage - even Sukhbir knew the place had been picked clean, and was quick to recommend better places to scavenge. But the Sikhs were dedicated, if nothing else. They were working hard repairing the damage, and even offered to take Sukhbir in as their own. The boy thought long and hard about it, and Lal was shocked to hear the lad decide to stick with him."
  un_event_option.11.a: "The world had lost the Golden Temple, but Lal soon gained a son."
  un_event.12.t: "Unity"
  un_event.12.d: "Silence fell across the UNSTRATCOM control room as the wall-spanning world map display was updated for the final time.\n\nIt was so uneventful at first. The yellow coloring denoting territory being integrated shifted to blue, joining the shades of the surrounding areas. Pravin Lal exhaled, but the noise of it hardly reaches his ears as the cheers and applause began. Within moments, the room was filled with jubilation. Hopes long thought absurd had been realised, and a dream long thought lost had been achieved. The United Nations had succeeded, and unified the world under a single unified banner.\n\nUnification Day quickly saw the same ecstatic celebration erupt across the world. It was a day that would be loathed by many - those who preferred to go their own way, without the UN’s influence pervading every layer of their lives. But all across the world, hope reigned. Reconstruction projects, aid centers and peacekeeper encampments became the sites of impromptu celebrations. The following day would bring the usual toil and hardship, but it was clear that there was light at the end of the tunnel: a future that all of humanity was striving toward.\n\nIt wouldn’t be easy. It wouldn’t be quick. It wouldn’t be unopposed. But it was possible. And after a century of gloom and years of bloodshed, things were finally looking up for humanity and their battered, blue planet.\n\nPravin Lal stood by the back of UNSTRATCOM control, but he couldn’t avoid the attention for long. Sukhbir - up long past his bedtime - gave him an affectionate punch in the side and grinned up at him, hardly resembling a wasteland urchin anymore. Yarina made a beeline from the SAESB-TACCOM desk to gather Lal up in a hug, exclaiming something in Portuguese that he couldn’t understand but could tell was joyous. She’d barely released him when his commlink buzzed with a congratulatory message from Curator Dorn at the UN Museum in Geneva, quickly followed by another from Doctor Usian. Attached to Usian’s message was an additional gift: an image of the newly-forged plaque for the Pria Memorial Clinic, set to open on the outskirts of Nairobi the following week.\n\nThings wouldn’t be the same. Not like they were before the Great Mistake. Not like they were before the Fourth American Civil War. But amidst the doubts that ever weighed on his mind, Lal felt acceptance of the fact. And looking around at the faces of his friends and family, he felt a sense of hope blooming inside him like he hadn’t felt in years."
  un_event_option.12.a: "The world will be as one."
  un_event.13.t: "Orbital Mechanics"
  un_event.13.d: "Never had the United Nations operated such a craft so advanced, the one Pravin Lal was watching on the launch pad, waiting patiently for its maiden flight. Lal was eager to witness such a spectacle, a spectacle that would give the United Nations a new advantage. This craft was the Comet, the United Nations’ new experimental fightercraft, capable of space operations if attached to a booster. It had taken months to design this craft, as well as its launcher, as new ways to launch it faster and from anywhere are being researched as well.\n\nLal watched the countdown timer above him, as time slowly crawled its way to zero. The engineers raced away from the launch pad, and the mission control personnel were busy like bees in their stations. The timer continued ticking down…forty, to thirty, to twenty. Lal’s mind was all over the place, he was anxious to see if the UN’s new fighter would succeed, or, quite literally, crash and burn. The timer reached ten seconds…nine…eight…smoke appeared from the pad. Six…five…four…three…two…one… the Comet lifted from the ground with such speed and brightness, it blinded some of those who were still a bit too close. The engineers cheered as the rocket rose and the pilot reported everything to be nominal. Lal would smile, as the rocket disappeared into the heavens above."

It now exists as a shadow of its former self, laid low by the Great Mistake, by subsequent conflicts, and in many areas by plain and simple neglect. Rebuilding these highways will be crucial in mobilizing military and humanitarian assets, as well as rebuilding a continent-spanning economy."

  ONU_integrate_world_economies:0 "Integrate World Economies"
  ONU_integrate_world_economies_desc:0 "Prior to the Great Mistake, the world economy was globalized like never before. Not only are those days long gone, but national economies are in increasingly haphazard condition or esoteric structure. Integrating the economies of liberated regions will be a tremendous challenge, with no one-size-fits-all process for doing so. But that doesn’t make the task any less crucial to our efforts."

The Secretariat will be the administrative branch. The General Assembly will serve as a worldwide parliament. The International Criminal Court of Justice will restore international law. The Economic and Social Council will lead the fight to rebuild from the Great Mistake. And the Security Council will lead the fight to bring peace and stability to our stricken world."
  ONU_draft_specialized_agencies:0 "Draft Specialized Agencies"
  ONU_draft_specialized_agencies_desc:0 "Besides the principal organs, the United Nations consisted of many specialized agencies, promoting international cooperation across various fields. If we are to halt Earth’s decline and even begin to recover from the Great Mistake in earnest, then international cooperation will be more important than ever. These agencies must not only return, but come back as strong and impactful as possible."

  ONU_rebuild_the_unwto_desc:0 "The role of the United Nations World Tourism Organization is an anachronistic one in a world where tourism is a dead industry. Widespread poverty, collapse of international travel and the ever-looming spectre of conflict make it rare for travel between nations outside of corporate business, governmental affairs or military invasion. But tourism is a constructive tool for forging cultural bonds and understanding, which we cannot overlook if we are to build a truly global society."

We can still unite as a species, upholding the values of peace and freedom as we rebuild a new world for everyone to enjoy. But it becomes clearer with each passing day that this will not come easily. In our way stands shortsighted nationalists, obstinate reactionaries and psychopathic corporate sycophants, all willing to sacrifice humanity’s future for their own gain.

In order to facilitate their mission, we will establish a new Force Commander Office as the capstone of our reorganized Peacekeeping Forces. While they can be vetoed by the Security Council, our Force Commander will be the highest ranking leader of the Peacekeeping Forces.

  ONU_reestablish_human_rights_desc:0 "In a world of growing conflict, widespread poverty and perpetual ‘emergency powers’, human rights are rapidly becoming forgotten. Even the most democratic of nations look to strongarm their people to serve misguided national interests or indulge in petty power-plays. While the UN is not free of sin in that regard, we are at least willing to try and uphold our values. By bringing back the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, offering them to all regardless if they stand by us or not, we will send a powerful statement to the world that we will stand by our ideals."

  ONU_unstratcom_desc:0 "United Nations Strategic Command will be the nexus of our global peacekeeping operations. Equipped with the most cutting-edge technology and the finest military minds we can muster, UNSTRATCOM will command our forces on a strategic level.

  ONU_blue_helmet_deployment:0 "Blue Helmet Deployment"
  ONU_blue_helmet_deployment_desc:0 "Winning a war still runs the risk of losing the peace. Even in the territory we do liberate, misguided partisans and deranged holdouts still pose tremendous risk to our personnel and the civilian population.

  ONU_the_peacekeeper_model_desc:0 "No matter what, we cannot lose sight of the fact that our forces are not just soldiers, but peacekeepers.

While we many once have been enemies, it’s possible to make use of their experiences for our own gain. We can convince those who fight out of a love for their country that we are their best option for protecting it, while those who joined the army for food and shelter will be easily bribed. Even so, we will need to be on the lookout for nationalist sentiment, which could very easily sabotage our efforts if left untreated."

  ONU_beachhead_iceland:0 "Beachhead: Iceland"
  ONU_beachhead_iceland_desc:0 "While Iceland is far from the most strategically-important part of Europe or even the North Sea Alliance, it is still an under-defended landmass that would serve as a potential launching point for European operations.

  ONU_spread_pan_european_ideals:0 "Spread Pan-European Ideals"
  ONU_spread_pan_european_ideals_desc:0 "Pan-Europeanism has become surprisingly widespread in recent decades, to the point of recent tensions on the continent boiling down to disagreements on what shape a united Europe should take and who gets to call the shots. With Europe becoming united under our banner, it would be wasteful not to lean into these ideals. By leaning into Pan-European rhetoric and recognising the motivating factors behind it, we can help bring the once-divided continent together and heal the divides that once ran through it."
  ONU_to_the_urals:0 "To The Urals"
  ONU_to_the_urals_desc:0 "The anarchic conditions of the Eurasian Union pale in comparison to the Urals.

  ONU_dominate_the_mediterranean_desc:0 "For all its pretensions of democracy, Franco-Iberia has traditionally held very elitist ideals and cared more about culture than the people who inhabit it. It’s not surprising that it has steadfastly denounced our efforts.

  ONU_from_panama_to_patagonia_desc:0 "South America is strategically important for a number of reasons. It is connected to our North American heartland by land, allowing for a ground invasion in some capacity. It is home to ecologically critical areas that must be stabilised as soon as possible. But perhaps most of all, almost all of its population live under authoritarianism, militarism, corporatism, or some unholy mix. Our southern neighbors cannot be left to suffer any longer."
  ONU_police_action_in_mexico:0 "Police Action In Mexico"
  ONU_police_action_in_mexico_desc:0 "Having long broken off from the NAU, Mexico remains an independent but increasingly unstable neighbor.

  ONU_urbanize_mexico:0 "Urbanize Mexico"
  ONU_urbanize_mexico_desc:0 "While Mexico’s cities are overcrowded and their services overexerted, encouraging urbanisation would allow us to turn unproductive land into nature preserves and renewable energy projects.

  ONU_horizontal_rebuilding_scheme:0 "Horizontal Rebuilding Scheme"
  ONU_horizontal_rebuilding_scheme_desc:0 "Rather than placing even more pressure on Mexico’s overcrowded cities, we should encourage people to move to the country and reverse the decline of rural communities.

  ONU_break_through_the_andes_desc:0 "The rise of the Andean Compact was an unexpected one, but left the nation a bastion of prosperity and liberty in South America. Unfortunately, while the nation is free and democratic, it has become increasingly dominated by corrupt corporate interests. The Compact and its corporate puppetmasters have shown no indication of joining us willingly, and their lithium reserves are too strategically important for us to pass up on."
  ONU_work_with_compact_loyalists:0 "Work With The Compact Loyalists"
  ONU_work_with_compact_loyalists_desc:0 "While far from a perfect society, the Andean Compact shared many of the values that we treasure. Though the usual nationalist sentiments are flaring up in response to the nation’s integration, some former politicians and business leaders are proving unusually cooperative. Encouraging closer ties and a few special deals will leave the Andes in a respectable position in the UN, not to mention a wealthy one."

  ONU_internationalize_lithium_deposits_desc:0 "Lithium is an increasingly rare and increasingly valuable resource, used in critical industrial processes and the manufacture of batteries.

  ONU_enter_brazil_desc:0 "We are going to Brazil: a nation that has not only been wracked by violence and unrest since before the Great Mistake, but holds most of what precious little remains of the Amazonian Rainforest. Stabilising the ecological situation in the region will be just as vital as restoring peace."
  ONU_saesb:0 "SAESB"
  ONU_saesb_desc:0 "The South American Ecological Services Board is an oddity among our planned regional administrations. While we are obviously committed to protecting the people of South America, the restoration of the Amazonian Rainforest is also a strategic ecological priority.

  ONU_eradicate_militarism:0 "Eradicate Militarism"
  ONU_eradicate_militarism_desc:0 "Once again, our work to bring peace to the world through force leads to confusion, with many believing that we are far more militaristic than we truly are. We must make it clearer that we fight only as a last resort in a desperate bid to save humanity, ultimately in the hopes of bringing and preserving peace. Though with so many in South America used to militarism, we can at least direct them to the nearest recruiting office so that they may be of use."
  ONU_pacify_the_amazon:0 "Pacify The Amazon"
  ONU_pacify_the_amazon_desc:0 "As precious as the Amazon is to conservation efforts, it’s also the perfect hiding spot for rebels and holdouts.

  ONU_pacify_india_desc:0 "India was ground zero of the Great Mistake, and never fully recovered. The once-proud nation has become a wasteland beset by violence and poverty, with even Thakur’s admirable efforts at unification proving inadequate at containing the degradation. Rebuilding the nation will be our greatest humanitarian challenge yet, but before we can even consider it we will need to clear out the petty warlords who have claimed chunks of the subcontinent as their territory."
  ONU_the_religions_debate:0 "The Religions Debate"
  ONU_the_religions_debate_desc:0 "Moving into deeply religious areas such as India and the Middle East raises some deeply important questions about how we approach religion. While the UN is a secular organisation that supports religious freedoms, we are increasingly coming to represent people from faiths all across the globe, and in many cases no formal religion or spiritual belief at all. We must re-examine our stance on religion and determine if it some adjustment is in order."
  ONU_unia:0 "UNIA"
  ONU_unia_desc:0 "Under our guidance, peace is already returning to the Indian Subcontinent. Under the United Nations Indian Administration, this will only continue. It won’t be an easy process, however. Parts of India have simply not recovered from the Great Mistake, remaining impoverished or in outright anarchy. Blue helmets will be a common sight in those areas for a long time to come."
  ONU_ungmra:0 "UNGMRA"
  ONU_ungmra_desc:0 "Since our days establishing ourselves in North America, we have been hard at work rebuilding from the Great Mistake. It was never going to be an easy task, and even our best efforts have proven patchwork at best. That is why we need to vastly overhaul the United Nations Great Mistake Reconstruction Agency - our principal organ dedicated solely to reversing the damage of the Great Mistake. With its expanded jurisdiction, it will coordinate a global ecological, economic and political response to the Great Mistake, doing everything humanly possible to reverse the effects and prevent further decline. It is an endeavour that may take generations, but it is increasingly one that we are undertaking as a united species."
  ONU_in_the_pacific:0 "In The Pacific"
  ONU_in_the_pacific_desc:0 "The Pacific was hit hard by the Great Mistake, losing many cities and a lot of infrastructure to the waves. While remarkable progress has been made in recovering, these measures are reaching their limits and cracks in the Pacific order are growing. All the while, the shadow of China looms large, and increasingly more people living under it grow discontent with its rule."
  ONU_beachhead_in_new_zealand:0 "Beachhead In New Zealand"
  ONU_beachhead_in_new_zealand_desc:0 "New Zealand is overlooked even in the Federation of Australasia, very much being a junior partner. Not only can we bring much-needed aid to its shores, but its geographic position makes it a perfect launching point for an invasion of the much more strategically important Australian mainland."
  ONU_modern_island_hopping:0 "Modern Island Hopping"
  ONU_modern_island_hopping_desc:0 "Our intervention in the Pacific increasingly involves rapid movement between islands, which is putting our navy and its crews to the test. UNTACCOM has compiled a list of proposed improvements to our designs and processes, which would greatly expedite our naval operations."
  ONU_pacify_australia:0 "Pacify Australia"
  ONU_pacify_australia_desc:0 "While Australia is the heart of Australasia, it is still a hot and dry nation that has only become hotter and drier since the Great Mistake. Liberating it will require careful consideration to the effects of heat exhaustion even in developed areas. Our forces deployed further inland will have it even harder, and will need to conserve water in the parched outback."
  ONU_the_nusantaran_connection:0 "The Nusantaran Connection"
  ONU_the_nusantaran_connection_desc:0 "Despite the Pacific being hit hardest by rising sea levels, Nusantara is something of a rising power in the region. It has quickly closed the gap with Australasia, though it’s not without its own internal conflicts. Still, with so many communities forced from their traditional homelands by the rising tides, intervention in the area is an urgent necessity to help them get back on their feet."
  ONU_the_indochina_question:0 "The Indochina Question"
  ONU_the_indochina_question_desc:0 "Mainland Asia is very much China’s sphere of influence, with the nations there having turned north in the face of rising oceans and escalating refugee crises. These same issues wrack the area to this day, and we must act to free its people from the incompetence of their pro-China leaders."
  ONU_resolve_the_burmese_issue:0 "Resolve The Burmese Issue"
  ONU_resolve_the_burmese_issue_desc:0 "While China’s influence is lower in the west of mainland Asia, this only means it is more unstable. If we are to bring order to Asia, Burma and its surrounding nations will be our next area of operations."
  ONU_ultimatum_to_japan:0 "Ultimatum To Japan"
  ONU_ultimatum_to_japan_desc:0 "Japan is a highly modern nation that - despite its island nature - has managed to survive the Great Mistake in a very good position economically and technologically. While this is thanks in no small part to its underregulated corporate sector, we cannot ignore that the country is still a shining example of freedom and democracy in the region. We may even be able to convince them to join us peacefully, with the right concessions on the table."
  ONU_police_action_in_china:0 "Police Action In China"
  ONU_police_action_in_china_desc:0 "The People’s Republic of China survived the Great Mistake to become the world’s sole remaining superpower. And yet, it continues to oppress its people under totalitarian rule, and has strongarmed its neighbours into its sphere of influence. While the country has been weakened by civil conflict, the people of China still call out for their freedom both in their homeland and in the frozen wastes of Siberia. We have heard their cries and will answer, but it will not be an easy fight for us."
  ONU_unca:0 "UNCA"
  ONU_unca_desc:0 "The United Nations Chinese Administration will, obviously, be our administrative branch for China. However, it will also cover the former Chinese-led Chita-Nurgan Republic, in addition to the increasingly Chinese-majority Siberia. These areas have known considerable civil and ethnic clashes over recent years, and we will need to allocate additional personnel to keep the peace."
  ONU_end_the_ideological_disputes:0 "End The Ideological Disputes"
  ONU_end_the_ideological_disputes_desc:0 "Despite its status as a superpower, China has recently undergone a civil war over deeply conflicting ideologies, which continue to be a flashpoint of tensions within the UNCA. While we may be forced to clamp down on some of the more authoritarian and militant elements, paying lip service to the more palatable ideologies may help placate some of the idealogues."
  ONU_asian_superhighway_developmental_funds:0 "Asian Superhighway Developmental  Funds"
  ONU_asian_superhighway_developmental_funds_desc:0 "Asia’s transportation networks have been severely damaged by the recent Chinese Civil War and our own Unification Conflict. As a show of goodwill to the locals, we will not only repair the damage to the networks, but invest in their expansion."
