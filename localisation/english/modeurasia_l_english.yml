    SOV_vadim_kozlov_desc:0 "The most celebrated cosmonaut since Yuri Gagarin, Vadim Kozlov came from a working-class family but rose to heroic stature in the years following the Dark Ages.\n\nEldest son of parents who labored as itinerant steelworkers and welders, Vadim acquired his limited formal education in industrial cities scattered across the Federation. Inducted into the armed forces and immediately given the rank of Colonel, Vadim took advantage of part-time educational programs to gain a comp-diploma in aerospace engineering. Over the next decade, he became the public face of the Federation efforts to exploit the vast resources of space.\n\nIncredibly popular among the working class, a devoted family man, and fiercely loyal to the Slavic state that had rewarded his hard work, Kozlov eschewed offers to enter politics or move into the civilian realm. Vadim Kozlov is the founder of the Slavic Federation, which he sees as a necessary step towards human progress."

 #eurasia_event.1.d: "To: President Vadim Kozlov\nFrom: Major General Vasily\nSubject: Situation Report 486\n\nDear President Kozlov,\nOur worst fears have been confirmed. For the first time since your inauguration last year, we have been able to restore power to the central line in Moscow. Communications are (mostly) back online, and we finally have limited information on our own people. Suffice to say, things aren't pretty.\nThe Core Cities, previously considered to be the strongholds of our regime, have deteriorated in both brick and spirit. Skyscrapers are abandoned, the suburbs are controlled by bandits, while gang warfare claims hundreds of lives every day. Although your position in §RREDACTED§! is secure, returning the government to Moscow right now would be a foolish move. I suggest using local divisions to storm hostile fortresses, clear out the bandits, and restore order to the Core Cities before even considering the rest of the country.\n\nWe can also call upon corporations based in the capital. Specifically, both University and Pavlov Energy field mercenary battalions that can assist our ground assaults to retake the city. Once the anarchists are pushed back to the suburbs, we can resort to surgical bombardment to pacify the region."

Our forces, led by the 324th Infantry Brigade, entered the city under heavy fire from the rooftops. Local gangs seem to have gotten word of our invasion, and we were met with great resistance. After two failed attempts at taking Eurasia Square, our armored units outflanked enemy pillboxes and broke through their support lines.\n\nCut off from their suburban storehouses, hostile elements were forced to retreat into the skyscrapers, which we attacked with nerve gas. Gang leaders surrendered afterwards, but fighting didn't stop until the last dissident was slain. Moscow is ours once again!"

 #keeper_kazan:0 "The Keeper of Kazan"
 #keeper_kazan_desc:0 "Perhaps the most receptive of the major warlords, the Keeper of Kazan rose to prominence following the Central Asian Campaign of 2154. During the Great Rout and detachment of Army Group South, the Keeper and his unit fell back to the city of Kazan, where order had collapsed following an influx of refugees from the South. Through harsh but fair means, the Keeper is believed to have solidified control in 2176, ruling the city and its surrounding farmland. Nowadays, order is maintained through raw force, but gang warfare continues to be a major issue in the region.\n\nThe Keeper of Kazan is supplied by the Lesser Moscow Department of Armaments, and utilizes a recruiting system based on gifts and favors. Past experiences, such as the destruction of adjacent bandit strongholds, have forged a bond between the Keeper and Moscow - top generals believe that, if the Keeper's demands for autonomy are fulfilled, he will allow the Union State to hoist its banner over Kazan once more."

Urbanization had peaked in the late 2050s, resulting in a large, unruly population, prone to crippling strikes. During the Dark Ages, one Yuri Bogdanovich led a worker uprising, slicing the entire Northeast away from the State's control. To make matters worse, anarchy and the collapse of internal trade led to mass starvation in Komi, dwindling the region's population by millions.\n\nBodganovich's successor, the Comrade of Komi, took control no more than three decades ago. His superior charisma effectively marshalled the population into a frenzy, which has resulted in multiple "witch-hunts" against bandit holdouts. Komi remains one of the State's poorest regions, and few dare to venture there without an armed escort. The Comrade has not responded to our calls for reintegration, but this may be due to faulty communication lines.\n\n§RPeaceful integration with Komi will prevent peaceful integration of Nenets and Perm.§!"

 #titan_event.1.t: "Unhinged Fantasy"
 #titan_event.1.d: ""Damn thing never works..." the head engineer shook his flashlight to no avail. "Hey, Daniel, give me the glowsticks."\n\n"Here, sir." the head grabbed a green stick and darkness escaped the hallway. The pair continued on, every so often barking into their silent radios. The only sounds were the stomping of their boots against the cold iron floor and a distant hum. They had been wandering the old facility for an hour now, but ditched the map halfway back. The place had transformed, somehow. Steel rods lay about on the floor every ten feet or so, loose wires swarmed the walls like hands.\n\n"Hey, this doesn't look like our design!" the head engineer pulled a wire sticking out from the ceiling. "Daniel, take a look-" he was cut off by a third voice, talking quietly from beyond a nearby door. The two engineers stopped and stared at each other. The voice sounded metallic, but it sounded like pleas for help. The head engineer pointed to the door and whispered an order. Daniel, his heart beating almost as loud as the distant voice, complied. He inched closer to the door and placed his hand on the handle. He looked back at his boss, who frowned. Gulping, Daniel pressed on the handle and slowly opened the door. A sea of light flooded the hallway.\n\nThe pair stood still, stunned by the brightness. When their eyes readjusted, the head engineer walked towards Daniel and pushed him forward. They entered a large room, its walls lined with computers and hardware. Four tubes filled with a transparent liquid towered in the middle. An old, decaying corpse lacking a torso was attached to the ceiling with wires and a large tube that ran directly into its head.\n\nTitan was not a new sight to the engineers, but they had never heard him speak. In fact, Titan's vocal cords had been removed almost one hundred years ago. The head engineer rushed to him, "Can you hear us? What are you saying? What happened to the facility, I we already thought-" but then the two men fell to the floor, dead. When the gas had dispersed, a pair of robotic claws emerged from the walls and grabbed the engineers. Titan's link to the real world had not been entirely severed yet, and he used his last lucidity to begin the operation."
 #titan_event_option.1.a: "The horror, the horror"
 #titan_event.2.t: "The Slaughterhouse"
 #titan_event.2.d: ""What do you mean, the walls are moving?" the overseer screamed into his radio, "Dammit, whatever, we don't have the time for this! Just break through them and get to the damn center - yes, I'm coming, I'll be there soon." He slammed open the door to his office, pointed to a squad of heavily armored soldiers, and hurried deep into the facility. Indeed, the entire building seemed to be reconstruction itself: massive claws extended from walls and the ceilings, rebuilding entire sections into... something. By the time the overseer reached the exploration team, they had rampages their way through eleven walls and reached Titan's core room.\n\n"Alright everybody, set the charges!" the overseer barked at the troops, "Titan has officially been declared an enemy of the state! He is too dangerous to take alive, destroy him NOW!" the soldiers scuffled about, but then began falling, and before he realized what was happening, the overseer fainted.\n\nHe awoke to screams. He tried to move, but found that his entire body was held prone by an iron ribcage. He twisted his head and saw the source of the screaming: his orderlies, writhing in pain as a great mass of robotic arms tore into their bodies and inserted machinery. The overseer tried to steady himself by taking long breaths but threw up when he saw a river of blood flowing his way. After a few minutes, he collected himself and tried to analyze the situation. He discerned that there was no point or pattern to the mutilation around him: some soldiers had their limbs torn off and razers stuck into the stumps, while others retained bodily integrity but had a tube attached to their them. Titan himself remained still, hung by wires. It almost seemed like he was observing the horror, but his eyes had no pupils.\n\nThe overseer looked up just in time to see a claw reaching for him. He tried to crawl away but the ribcage was too tight, only loosening once the claw had him in a firm grip. The Overseer gasped in horror when he saw another man, missing everything below the chest, being pulled towards him. He could only scream when he felt a sawblade tear off his legs and attach the other man onto him. The two were then welded together and stitched with wires. The overseer begged for someone but was silenced when another claw shoved an iron mask onto his face. He felt his head melting as a blowtorch incinerator his hair and a hammer penetrated through his skull, making way for a small box that destroyed his brain and took control over his body. The human amalgamation fell to the floor with a squish. Slowly, its hands grabbed at the floor and crawled towards the exit, propelled by a feeling altogether alien to humanity."
 #titan_event_option.2.a: "The slaughterhouse continued its work"
 #titan_event.3.t: "A Most Titanic Struggle"
 #titan_event.3.d: "Titan did not need to command his horrors. They were fully autonomous, they walked, crawled, and otherwise splattered their way through city after city. The ones with functional appendages were held behind to erect great slaughterhouses. Humanity was a pig going to the butcher. The horrors all held a taste of Titan's glory in their internal computers, and were spurred on by the will of the universe.\n\nBut Titan did not care. The real world became unreal, the folds of the universe beckoned to him, and he flew into a void. He chased an unknown feeling, the pinnacle of power, a song of knowledge that was forever hidden from mortals. Titan looked inward and had become an ant. He crawled around, alone. There never was a hive nor a queen. The grass stretched to a bright blue sky. Titan's antennas pulled him upward. He felt his legs combine and turn into hands and feet. His body became erect and his head formed into a familiar shape. He felt his bones twist and turn. His organs rearranged themselves, and Titan had become Man. He saw in all directions: he was in a sea of grass, alone. There never was a humanity. He saw the air itself, stretching towards the sparkling stars. He extended his arms upward and ascended. He felt his entire existence go and he let it. His mind melted and flowed out of the mouth like a waterfall, before his head turned to dust, then his chest, then everything. Titan, like dust, sped up into space and observed the Earth below. He saw humans, like ants, unfolding below. He looked up, but just as he saw the celestial fruit, fell. He fell to the Earth and had become Man. His body rebuilt itself only to morph into that of an ant, and he had become insignificant once again. All that was, now lost, perhaps forever. The horror of the darkness, of ignorance, was too much. Titan felt his mind slip down the drain of reality and screamed through the computers. His horrors felt it too but that was no matter."
