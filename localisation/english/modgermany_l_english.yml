 GER_lena_ebner:0 "Lena Ebner"
 GER_lena_ebner_desc:0 "Born in Berlin to a German diplomat and a Polish teacher, Lena was raised as a "child of the world". Over the course of 15 years, she lived on four continents and learned to speak eight languages.\n\nLena fought fearlessly for refugee rights throughout central and eastern Europe. Her early work at the Braungart-Wissel Foundation for Environmental Law garnered her acclaim, and she was soon seen as an emerging leader of sustainability and the environmental policymaking. As she became a prominent lawyer-activist in post-Mistake Europe, Lena was an increasingly easy target for Franco-Iberian politicians. Painted as a desperate anarchist, Lena's non-traditional lifestyle and worldview was frequently highlighted in order to polarize moderates. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR.\n\nIt wasn't until Lena's most vocal and harshest critic (and cousin), Élodie, began her campaign for Franco-Iberian politics that Lena's vision for a transmodernist society crystallized. Transmodernism meant xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."

 germany_formable_desc:0 "INTEGR has very clear goals: to prevent the reactionary powers of Europe, whether north or east or west or south, from dividing and destroying what little is left of the Old Continent.\n\nThe power of the political platform is absolute in Germany, and has enabled it to form strong alliances with countries in Central Europe, and those to come. Much remains to be done, but many hope that its leaders will be up to the task.\n\nIntegration and legal parity between countries is the way to harmony in Europe... and on the entire planet.\n\n§LAnd on the edge of the abyss, Europe once again manages to emerge from a dark period. The sun's light shines with hope, its rays no longer burn as they used to. Europe is at last being reborn green. The colour of faith. Faith in the new and progressive Europe.§!"

 GER_anti_franco_iberian_desc:0 "Lena Ebner represents a watershed moment in the history of post-Mistake Europe. An event of this magnitude occurs only once a generation. Billed as "a response to the new imperialism", what actually this means is nothing less than a cogent new political philosophy, neither right nor left, dominionist nor green. A strong posture against Franco-Iberian agenda."
 GER_transhumanism_desc:0 "The "aristocratic spirit of seriousness" and "Ancien Regime of Western rationalistic technocracy" have motivated the politics of this age, with the agents of the state and entertainment serving as gatekeepers for what is "good" and what is "bad" for the people. Transmodernism means xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."
 GER_green_austerity_desc:0 "Lena bridged the gap between technocrat, activist, and environmentalist. In fact, it was Lena herself who suggested the Party restructure their organization under those three verticals. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR."

For this reason the "Green Soil" plan was signed by these three countries in 2194 with the aim of maintaining a dynamic, mutually supportive and green economy.\n\nSince then, relations between the three countries have only improved. In both countries the Initiative has great social support and is seen as the future of the region and of Europe as a whole.\n\nThe reality is that this treaty has led to an interdependence between the signatory countries, where if the economy of one were to fall, the economy of the other would be seriously affected. That is why the engagement between these countries will be long-lasting and prosperous, as long as the ambitions of European leaders do not get in the way."
