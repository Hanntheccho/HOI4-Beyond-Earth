 synthetic_democracy_desc:0 "§LThe "rule of the few" is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people sharing very specific characteristics. Different types of oligarchies can be found, including "technocracies", "stratocracies", "plutocracies" and even "theocracies".§!"

 corporate_libertarianism_desc:0 "§LAlthough rare in pre-Mistake society, minarchist governments have grown and expanded following a growing distrust in worldwide governments.\n\nIn a minarchist society, all government is kept to a minimum. Only by the use of minor taxes and government contracts does centralized action take place. Instead, a large part of the country is driven by interest groups, formed by either corporate interests, or people's organizations.§!"
 digital_democracy:0 "Digital Democracy"
 digital_democracy_effects:0 "Daily Political Power Gain: §G+0.50§!\nParty Popularity Stability Modifier: §G+50.00%§!"
 digital_democracy_desc:0 "§LWith the advent of globalism and mass communications, many governments were forced to cede power to their citizens. Continuing the prized legacy of popular government and the Social Contract, democracies are highly transparent, reducing corruption and backdoor deals.\n\nUnfourtunately, increased political participation, combined with mass media, contribute to a very polarized society, where passing even the simplest of bills is a long and complicated process.§!"

 military_government_desc:0 "§LFollowing the Great Mistake, even the mightiest of nations faltered and fell into the abyss of a new Dark Age. To salvage the situation, military and violent civilian groups took over certain countries, ruling with an iron fist. Although such governments claim to be a temporary measure, many exist for the sake of perpetuating an elite group.\n\nThe main aim of this form of government is to defend at all cost the way of life of the nation and preserve the national unity.§!"
 communal_parity:0 "Communal Parity"
 communal_parity_effects:0 "Surrender Limit: §G+10.00%§!\nWar Support: §G+20.00%§!\nDivision Defense on Core: §G+10.0%§!"
 communal_parity_desc:0 "§LA radical form of government in which there is no head of government. Instead power is devolved to local councils consisting of all individuals of that community, who then are able to send representatives to higher councils for regional or national matters. Representative in any field is not a permanent role and is elected only when required.\n\nIssues are voted on directly by all those who it would effect with consensus, not majority, being the objective.§!"

 anarchy_style_desc:0 "§LAn unstable government can be many things. Ranging from the absense of civilization to failed anarchist experiments, from massive mobs to unorthodox governments, an unstable government has difficulties in everything.\n\nPassing laws is borderline impossible, corruption can be found in all aspects of society, and the state - or what remains of it - is usually unable to collect taxes or field proper armies.§!"

 civilian_economy_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y50.0%§!\nFree Repair: §G+50.00%§!\n§G+200%§! Free Factory Rate"
 civilian_economy_desc:0 "Espousing a wide array of free-market ideals, Laissez-Faire economics prize the role of business and individual initiative in a free economy.\n\nMost industrial investment is done by companies, while the government is limited to influencing them with extra funding. Although the State has little choice on what to build, and where, in the long-run, the invisible hand is capable of modernizing an entire country. This does take some calibration, and less developed countries will not grow at the same rate as their modern competitors."

 low_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "Much like Laissez-Faire, a deregulated economy lets businesses do their thing, only occassionally nudging them along into a desired direction.\n\nHowever, should war or a crisis descend upon the nation, the government reserves the right to focus more on military spending, and calibrate the economy to its liking."

 partial_economic_mobilisation_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y30.0%§!\n§G+50%§! Free Factory Rate"
 partial_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "Combining the best of both worlds, a mixed economy is neither fully free, nor fully regulated. Although individuals retain the right to free enterprise, government intervention is regular and predictable. Many mixed economies rely on the State to provide welfare and regulations abound."
 war_economy:0 "Planned Economy"
 war_economy_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y20.0%§!\n§R-90%§! Free Factory Rate"
 war_economy_desc:0 "In a planned economy, the State controls the inputs and outputs of all enterprises. Businesses are generally owned by the government, although minor private ownership is allowed.\n\nWhile a planned economy can focus on a specific sector, the feedback and self-correction mechanisms are slow and often inaccurate. Some varieties of planned economies utilize synthetic intelligence to operate and organize society."
 tot_economic_mobilisation:0 "Collectivization"
 tot_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "A collectivized economy is one that has fully shed all vestiges of private property. All assets are owned by a collective, which in turn decides where to spend its resources. This often leads to wildly inaccurate and bad investments, but manipulating the economy is extremely easy."
