 civilian_economy_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y50.0%§!\nFree Repair: §G+50.00%§!\n§G+200%§! Free Factory Rate"
 civilian_economy_desc:0 "Espousing a wide array of free-market ideals, Laissez-Faire economics prize the role of business and individual initiative in a free economy.\n\nMost industrial investment is done by companies, while the government is limited to influencing them with extra funding. Although the State has little choice on what to build, and where, in the long-run, the invisible hand is capable of modernizing an entire country. This does take some calibration, and less developed countries will not grow at the same rate as their modern competitors."
 low_economic_mobilisation:0 "Deregulated Economy"
 low_economic_mobilisation_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y40.0%§!\nFree Repair: §G+25.00%§!\n§G+100%§! Free Factory Rate"
 low_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "Much like Laissez-Faire, a deregulated economy lets businesses do their thing, only occassionally nudging them along into a desired direction.\n\nHowever, should war or a crisis descend upon the nation, the government reserves the right to focus more on military spending, and calibrate the economy to its liking."
 partial_economic_mobilisation:0 "Mixed Economy"
 partial_economic_mobilisation_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y30.0%§!\nFree Repair: §G+10.00%§!\n§G+50%§! Free Factory Rate"
 partial_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "Combining the best of both worlds, a mixed economy is neither fully free, nor fully regulated. Although individuals retain the right to free enterprise, government intervention is regular and predictable. Many mixed economies rely on the State to provide welfare and regulations abound."
 war_economy:0 "Planned Economy"
 war_economy_effects:0 "Consumer Goods Factories: §Y20.0%§!\nBuilding Repair Speed: §G+50.00%§!\n§R-90%§! Free Factory Rate"
 war_economy_desc:0 "In a planned economy, the State controls the inputs and outputs of all enterprises. Businesses are generally owned by the government, although minor private ownership is allowed.\n\nWhile a planned economy can focus on a specific sector, the feedback and self-correction mechanisms are slow and often inaccurate. Some varieties of planned economies utilize synthetic intelligence to operate and organize society."
 tot_economic_mobilisation:0 "Collectivization"
 tot_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "A collectivized economy is one that has fully shed all vestiges of private property. All assets are owned by a collective, which in turn decides where to spend its resources. This often leads to wildly inaccurate and bad investments, but manipulating the economy is extremely easy."
