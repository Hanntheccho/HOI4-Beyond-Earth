  scotland_event.1.t: "Welcome To Kaunas"
  scotland_event.1.d: "The Baltic Union, a tacit ally of the NSA, has recently provoked the ire of INTEGR. The Kaunas Massacre, in which INTEGR demonstrators were fired upon by government forces in a gross misunderstanding, or at least we hope it’s a misunderstanding, has sent the Baltic Union into chaos. Either way, this has led to a heightening of tensions between the Balts and Poles, the Poles wishing to inflict diplomatic and military punishment upon the Balts for the Kaunas Massacre. Poland has moved troops to the border of the Baltic Union and has sent an ultimatum, an ultimatum that they know will never be accepted. The Polish-Baltic conflict is not expected to be a full scale war, but likely a border conflict of enough intensity to give Germany and Poland an excuse to break off an INTEGR-aligned Lithuania and smother the Baltic experiment in its sleep.\n\nThe Kaunas Massacre has ignited the Baltic Union’s political and ethnic issues into a raging inferno that seeks to burn down the country. At least we’re known for being good with water."

  scotland_event.2.t: "Intervention in the Norway-Sweden War"
  scotland_event.2.d: "One of our allies in the North Sea Alliance, Norway, has recently launched an invasion of Sweden. Scandinavia was one of the last places anyone would’ve expected a war just some time ago, a traditionally friendly and peaceful region, at least after the medieval era. All of that changed yesterday with the invasion of Sweden. Some claim that we pushed Norway into doing this. Admittedly that is partly true. Sweden, if pushed, would likely ally with Germany, and in the case of a war, would be able to storm through Norway and use it as a staging ground for an invasion of Scotland. This would obviously be disastrous for everyone in the NSA, but Norway also has its own goals in the invasion. The resources contained in Sweden would be very useful for the Nordic ARK project they keep lobbying us for, jealous of the Edinburgh ARK and the under construction London ARK. If we helped them, there may be more issues within the alliance, but the Germans would be less of an issue in the future, we must choose wisely."

  scotland_event.3.t: "Mistaken Identity"
  scotland_event.3.d: "Magdalena Bazinsz - Wife of Polish leader released after diplomatic scandal.\n\nPrime Minister Duncan Hughes has described the incident as "A grave mistake" and "an unfortunate error", much to the anger of Polish diplomats who wish to see proper compensation and criminal trials.\n\nOn Saturday, operatives from the Ionad Falaichte mistook the wife of the Polish President, Magdalena Bazinsz, for a foreign saboteur. Magdalena was detained under the 2197 Espionage and Sabotage Prevention Act, after intelligence officers assumed that the Polish First Lady was an INTEGR saboteur after she was seen to have trespassed on government property. However, it turned out that she was on a diplomatic visit. The IF operatives were unconvinced of this excuse however and kept her detained.\n\n As tensions run higher and higher in Europe, more accusations of foreign espionage have been tossed around the continent. This suspicion has morphed into blanket xenophobia in some cases, as with the case of Magdalena Bazinsz.\n\nAfter a large diplomatic furor was hurled Scotland’s way by INTEGR countries, Scotland released Magdalena from custody with great apology. The Polish embassy in Glasgow has requested that the IF operatives responsible be prosecuted. The Scottish government has declined this demand."

  scotland_event.4.t: "Something Fishy"
  scotland_event.4.d: "The docks of the Edinburgh ARK are some of the largest and busiest docks in Europe, everything in northern Europe has gone through these docks at one point. Unfortunately, this isn’t always a good thing. The vast size of the docks, and the large market in England has made Edinburgh an extremely profitable venture for drug and weapons smugglers. Of course, there are state of the art contraband detection systems and chemical detection systems, but weirdly enough they always seem to detect barely any contraband.\n\nCorruption had set into the docks years ago, and the Italian Mafia, Dutch Kliek, Russian Bratva and English Firms had all begun paying exorbitant bribes to ship contraband into the British Isles through the Edinburgh ARK. A few years ago, a large crackdown on bribery and smuggling in the Edinburgh docks required regular checks on the amount of contraband detected and more frequent inspections from anonymous inspectors on a frequent rotation.\n\nThis didn’t go as planned. Various criminal organisations now just bribe workers to report false positives instead. This came to a head yesterday, when journalists found out how far up the chain the corruption went. Not just mafiosos and viajeros;  local politicians also got involved to tell the dock workers to report false positives on foreign goods, attempting to please their voter bases of working class men and women. The most common goods blocked from entering were German cod, Icelandic cod and Eurasian steel. Needless to say, this has caused a large amount of tension between us and our trading partners."

  scotland_event.5.t: "Faux Papakha"
  scotland_event.5.d: "”I understand that our nations have had some issues over the last few years, with the tensions involving European factions, pacts, alliances and other things that seek to divide us. But I truly believe that proper diplomacy can work through the issues we face in modern Europe.” Duncan Hughes cleared his throat. “Scotland and the North Sea Alliance don’t wish to tear Europe apart like the ideologues of France and Germany, nor are we only focused on our own goals like the Russians. We truly seek a better Europe.”\n\nThe crowd clapped with a lack of enthusiasm, even less so than was expected from the Finnish crowd, not known for showing much affection as is. Duncan shifted an awkward gaze at his advisors and diplomats waning in the back of the conference room.\n\nThe Finnish Prime Minister moved onto the stage with an uncomfortable stumble in their steps. Although not explicit, a tone of apology was quite apparent to Hughes’ translator. There was then a round of applause, a bow, a handshake and everyone went back to homebase to organise the actual diplomatic talks that wouldn’t be broadcast.\n\n”The hat, sir, the one you were wearing onstage.”\n\n”It’s a traditional Finnish hat that would let the people of Finland know that the NSA is aware of their culture and doesn't seek to wipe it away, that we’re not a bunch of ignoramuses.”\n\n”Traditionally Finnish, contemporarily popular in the Eurasian Republic. Pretty much everything you said wasn’t taken seriously, expect to see a heap of drama about this in the Finnish datalinks by tea time.”\n\n”Oh, for god’s sake, why wasn’t I told about this? Anything else I should be told about in hindsight?”\n\n”Yes, sir. The Finnish diplomats are talking about holding talks with Germany and Franco-Iberia instead very soon.”"

  scotland_event.6.t: "I’m The Taxman"
  scotland_event.6.d: "The Republic of Iceland is a country that should not exist as an independent nation, assuming that all things in this world are logical. It is a tiny island in a strategically important location, allowing whoever controls it to enforce control over a large part of the Arctic Ocean. Whilst Scotland is Iceland’s protector, Iceland still maintains large amounts of autonomy within the NSA. Unfortunately, Iceland is not naturally rich, large in population or militarily powerful. It resorted to what the political scientist Akello Malinga described as ‘The Alpine Method’ of running a state, which he named after the famously free and scrupulous economies of Padania, and the formerly independent Switzerland. Iceland makes most of its money via providing a safe environment for European companies to dodge taxes and regulations.This tax-dodging particularly vexes the Eurasians and Franco-Iberians, who are forced to watch as their upper classes and corporations hide their wealth in Icelandic bank accounts.\n\nAfter repeated sanctions had failed to stop Iceland from extracting Europe’s wealth for the NSA, Eurasia and Franco-Iberia announced a rare collaborative effort to reclaim their lost tax money. An ultimatum was sent a month ago to Iceland and the NSA as a whole, of which, the conditions could be summarised as ‘Stop being a tax haven or we’ll be forced to use force.’ Last week, the Franco-Iberian and Eurasian governments announced a planned blockade on Iceland, implicitly threatening to start a conflict with the NSA if their demands are not met.\n\nHowever, yesterday, God smiled upon Iceland and Scotland as DannyeKorp, a datalink company in Russia, ‘allegedly’ began burying Eurasian propaganda on the Eurasian datalinks, even threatening to stop taking down Vostoslavian propaganda on the datalinks. This caused Eurasia to back out of the ultimatum, leaving Franco-Iberia to face the NSA on its own, withdrawing the ultimatum. Luckily for us, this doesn’t seem to have escalated like it seemed like it could’ve, yet."

  scotland_event.7.t: "Terminal Velocity"
  scotland_event.7.d: "”Jim, come have a look at this.” The radar operator pointed at a large anomaly that the radar AI had decided to be a possibly hostile aircraft. “That’s pretty hard to ignore if you ask me.”\n\n”Nae, nae, nae, we can’t be at war, I know you’ve been saying this would happen for a while, be prepared, all of that bollocks, but no, not happening, we’d’ve heard about it from upstairs, surely.” Jim took in a breath deeper than any before in his life, and looked at the radar operator with a forlorn acceptance on his face. “It’s a first strike, isn’t it? The bleeding Francos and Inties are finally returning fire.” Jim looked around the room, shuffling his feet, sending messages up the chain of command with his DataLinker. A minute that felt like an hour passed, Jim thought of what would happen if they were to fire, many innocent people could die. He then turned his attention to what’d happen if they didn’t fire, many innocent people could die, many many more than if they returned fire. Not just innocent people, but innocent Scottish people, innocent NSA people, his people, his fellow countrymen and alliancemen.\n\n”Fire.”\n\n”FIRE!” Screamed the pilot of the private jet, not realising that half of his craft had been blown into smithereens, his interface telling him that a fire had merely broken out on board. He looked at the camera going into the cabin and saw there was very little left of the cabin. The diplomats from France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Germany and England had all been vaporised. The European diplomats were on their way to Arcopolis, neutral ground, in an attempt to forge some sort of assurance against the upcoming European conflict. The attempt at peace in Europe had been shot down over Europe, that sent a message if anything."

   #scotland_event.8.t: "Matters of Employment"
   #scotland_event.8.d: ""Mr Hughes!" Exclaimed Barbara Taylor, attempting to force enthusiasm through vocal cords just as tired as the rest of her body.\n"Don’t worry, Barbara, I’ve just called so we can go over some basic stuff about, you know, how we’re gonna be running things in The Isles now that the war’s over." Duncan was sure the English Prime Minister was rolling her eyes on the other end of the call, but that wouldn’t stop him. "We had our analysts, advisors, political scientists, historians, all those sorts, analyse some of the causes behind the war in England, how it matched up with similar historical events, etcetera. You know, so we don’t end up repeating any mistakes and all that."\n"You’re going to tell me how my country works now?" Barbara sighed out, mouthing the implied ‘yes’ that she expected to hear. "We do have analysts too, you know?"\n"Yes, I’ve read through those reports, half of them blamed Nigel and the other half blamed bams and the poor. Whereas we found in most of our reports, and you’re not going to like this, that most of the problems that led to the civil war were caused by rampant inequality in the south and the huge unemployment problem country-wide."\n\nBarbara, increasingly insulted and tired by Hughes’ implicit accusations of incompetence simply tried to end the call with, "Can we just agree to govern either side of the border? Let the English government sort out English problems for English people. The young men in Nussex who sympathised with the English Front and Spring Party may hate me, but they hate the Scots more."\n"You still want NSA money, though? For the London ARK, industry projects and the New Birmingham Plan?" Duncan then remembered why he had called in the first place. "Speaking of those projects, I think they’re the solution to your problem. If we can bring back the industry in the south, give England some of its balls back. We can employ all the young angry men in factories and ARK construction projects, which hopefully stops them from bombing datalink sites. Sound good?""
   #scotland_event_option.8.a: "Yes, Mr Hughes, it sounds fine…"
  scotland_event.9.t: "The English Frontline"
  scotland_event.9.d: "Nigel John-Hall’s English Front launched its assault upon the NSA-aligned regime in England under the promise from Franco-Iberia that an English Front-ruled England would be under the protection of France. However, with the recent election of Al-Hakim to the French presidency, that French alliance clearly will not happen. Al-Hakim and Nigel John-Hall disagree on literally every point imaginable, and an alliance between the two would just devolve into diplomatic conflict, or literal conflict. This leaves England as a pariah state with no one coming to save it. They are too nationalistic for the French, too technophobic for the NSA and INTEGR finds them disgusting in every meaning of the word possible. If we were to launch a military operation into England, no one in Europe would be able to counter it effectively."
  scotland_event_option.9.a: "The final chapter plays out."
  scotland_event.10.t: "The NSA Expands to [?global.just_joined_nsa^0.GetName]"
  scotland_event.10.d: "The geopolitical make-up of Europe continues to change as yet another nation joins the Scottish led North Sea Alliance. Considered by some to be an off-shoot of the long collapsed NATO, the NSAs new member count has increased the alliance's economic and military power. With the NSA gaining access to a major amount of resources, other nations in Europe start to feel increasingly threatened. As ever, the leadership has vowed to defend any and all of its members from any 'foreign aggression', while critiques of the NSA have denounced the expansion as little more that 'diplomatic imperialism'."

However, now the sea comes in sweeping lives, towns, and entire cities out to sea, never to be seen again. Though other people cry and weep before they give in to the sea, we do not, and will not. As always we fight, for once, not with sword and rifle but with shovel and crane. Even now, we lead a war against the very sea itself, reclaiming from its depths what it has stolen. Massive pipes pump water away, as with steel and concrete we build vast walls to reclaim land and keep the sea out."
  SCO_the_arks_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the project's divine namesake, we have built great cities upon the sea that have taken so much. Each city is an ark, to preserve humanity, an industrial monument of economy and skill. Each one is a hub of human traffic, as everyone seeks a place on the arks. Demand outweighs supply as usual during a disaster."
  SCO_the_nsa_desc:0 "The North Sea Alliance is a great idea, one that could bear powerful fruit. For now it is an alliance crumbling from within as old rivalries resurface and delusions of grandeur seep into the politics. This is exemplified by the two most powerful members, Scotland and England. England shudders and wails in pain as it crumbles from within, vultures fighting over her heart. Scotland strives to make a new future separate from England, but fears the chaos of the South and English stubbornness. Though if these troubles can be overcome, it shall grow in strength as new member states join the pact, fulfilling its namesake as it claims dominion over the North Sea."

Before the former Netherlands disappeared from the map, the alliance was used by many of the countries to coordinate gigantic engineering works to fight against the designs of nature.\n\nWhat was lost in the Netherlands may be irretrievable, but the North Sea Alliance has made incredible progress in terms of terrain modification and adaptation to the rising tide. Large cities, floating or not, pump water back into the sea with enormous efficiency, waves crash daily against the high walls erected to protect nations from the tides of nature.\n\nAll this has not prevented the Alliance from finding itself in a weak spot.

  SCO_duncan_hughes_desc:0 "Born to a local shipping magnate in the Scottish port city of Aberdeen, Duncan Hughes was something of an enigma when he first appeared on the political circuit roughly a decade ago. Schooled at the Sturgeon Naval College and given an otherwise comfortable upbringing, biographers have long since attributed the quirks of Hughes' personality to his time spent as a teenager working at his father's docks. His father had insisted he work as an apprentice longshoreman to instill a strong work ethic, and yet, the experience seems to have jaded Hughes, as the other dockhands had little regard for "a soft-handed boy underfoot" and paid him only as much attention as required. Still, some might say his father was right - in the present day, Hughes is known as a remarkably tireless man with little fear of difficult confrontations.\n\nHughes is recognized as one of the first to publicly acknowledge the growing gap between the North Sea Alliance's potential versus other world powers. Named as head of the Priority Development Committee, Hughes can be credited with securing many of the trade deals and alliances that allowed for the relatively swift ramp-up to national production."
