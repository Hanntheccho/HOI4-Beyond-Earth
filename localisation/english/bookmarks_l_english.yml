 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "BEYOND EARTH /////////////////////////////////"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The year was 2070. Tensions between two Asian powers, having reached a boiling point, spilled over all too quickly.\n\nInternational powers had no time to react and, before anyone knew it, a new Dark Age engulfed the world. The Golden Days were over.\n\nThe brief but deadly Pakistani-Indian War left an incredible footprint across the continent. Millions perished from famine, millions more were displaced. Soon the rest of the world felt the cold grip of ash. Economies collapsed. The satellites fell. The spirit of all nations was shaken.\n\nBut the Great Mistake did not end there. The lifestyle of modern societies, the exponential consumption of goods, the inability of people to look beyond tomorrow led to an even worse situation. The oceans swallowed entire cities. Societies enclosed on themselves, fighting wars of survival. The Earth, so close to globalization, fell far. The scars of bygone eons became visible once again. Hard times led to the development of new currents of thought, philosophies were forged to deal with the Great Mistake, with new technologies, with new problems.\n\nBut soon this era too will end. Civilizations across the world are awakening, one last time, to finish what they started, to bring balance to the world or to seek a second chance... Beyond Earth."
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "SOUTH AMERICA DEMO ///////////////////////"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Version 0.1 of this mod, showcasing its current development, and focused on the South American continent. This is the only area to have its full and complete 7-year content for most nations, although non-South American countries are still playable in the style of older Paradox GSGs. The demo nations vary greatly in terms of initial power and gameplay style, but all have paths to either unite South America or enter the world stage in some other form.\n\nIf this is your first playthrough of HOI4 - Beyond Earth, we highly recommend that you start with the Oriental League (Uruguay) as the bulk of its content consists of introducing new mechanics unique to the mod. If this is your first game of Hearts of Iron IV, we also highly encourage you to play vanilla or simpler mods before returning to HOI4 - Beyond Earth."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At the start of the 23rd century, Argentina starts in the middle of a civil war. We highly recommend this nation if you are interested in a:\n\n-Fast paced, action-packed game\n-Gameplay oriented game with minimal new mechanics\n-A game that plays like vanilla\n-Exploring the world of HOI4 - Beyond Earth without too much commotion"
 COL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""
 PRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The ancient countries of Peru and Bolivia had merged into the Andean Compact following the Great Mistake. While initially a simple economic bloc that aimed to ensure the survival of their regimes, its constituent members have gradually grown in size and influence. Due to vast lithium reserves, being the inheritors of the world's elite during the Great Mistake, and laying claim to rich lands virtually untouched by Global Warming, the Andean Compact begins the 23rd century as a superpower in all but name. We highly recommend this nation if you are interested in:\n\n-Slow, calculating gameplay\n-Many unique mechanics and political options\n-Roleplaying a stable and prosperous country in an ocean of flame\n-Building up and planning an economy rather than constantly fighting wars"
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Brazil is a land long divided. Although a global economic powerhouse during the Golden Age, the country has been striken with a serious case of political instability, indecisive government, and deurbanization. Brazil has, thus far, managed to avoid open civil war only through extensive militarization and by adopting a cutthroat and increasingly corrupt governmental style. However, the current President Manuel Velho has radical plans to revive his great nation through war and conquest, much to the dismay of those plotting grand revolutions from the dark. We highly recommend this nation if you are interested in:\n\n-Narrative style gameplay with a focus on characters\n-A fair mix between wars, unique mechanics, and industrial development\n-Roleplaying wildly different ideologies\n-Taking on daunting challenges that few may pass"
 COS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""
 URG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Oriental League arose from the ashes of old Uruguay. Trying to survive between the volatile powers of Brazil and Argentina did not do it any favors, and the country has gradually been fading into obscurity. However, a radical new movement for the revival of pan South American values has taken root in the cities, and there may be much more potential to tiny little Uruguay than anybody could have ever thought... We highly recommend this nation if you are interested in:\n\n-Learning about HOI4 - Beyond Earth and its fine details\n-Exploring this mod at your own pace\n-Turning small minors into world-dominating superpowers\n-Standing up to South America's strongest powers and winning titanic wars of tactics and policy"
