    SOV_fires_of_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia is burning. The Great Mistake has not only flooded the Vorkuta region but wiped entire cities off the map. The Caspian's sudden expansion shattered the Central Asian campaign of 2154, cutting off our nation's access to Asia. Entire steppes are catching fire, while warlord remnants continue to harass those who dare venture outside the Core Cities. Restoring Siberia to its former beauty is an impossible task, but we can still try and salvage what is left."
    SOV_centralized_military_desc:0 "The Eurasian Military, composed of the Army, Navy, Air and Space branches, is very young. Most soldiers are veterans of the Dark Ages, and many are still loyal to local warlords. Recent efforts to centralize the military around the "Verhuvnaya Commanda", based in the capital, have not been as successful as hoped. It would be naive to believe that the ragged men we call "soldiers" have anything but money in mind. All future campaigns should be executed quickly, lest the officers decide to switch loyalties."
    SOV_slavic_federation_desc:0 "The Slavic Federation is less of a unitary entity and more of an alliance of convenience. Eurasia, still viewing itself as the protector of "junior" Slavic peoples, sends out regular relief aid to other members. While a uniting force amongst our peoples, conservative elements of society argue for a more aggressive approach towards exerting foreign influence and believe that the Federation is more of a liability than a strength.\n\nBeing Kozlov's brainchild, he is unlikely to give it up, but there are rumors of growing discontent amongst its members."

  #LEADER
    SOV_vadim_kozlov:0 "Vadim Kozlov"
    SOV_vadim_kozlov_desc:0 "The most celebrated cosmonaut since Yuri Gagarin, Vadim Kozlov came from a working-class family but rose to heroic stature in the years following the Dark Ages.\n\nEldest son of parents who labored as itinerant steelworkers and welders, Vadim acquired his limited formal education in industrial cities scattered across the Federation. Inducted into the armed forces and immediately given the rank of Colonel, Vadim took advantage of part-time educational programs to gain a comp-diploma in aerospace engineering. Over the next decade, he became the public face of the Federation efforts to exploit the vast resources of space.\n\nIncredibly popular among the working class, a devoted family man, and fiercely loyal to the Slavic state that had rewarded his hard work, Kozlov eschewed offers to enter politics or move into the civilian realm. Vadim Kozlov is the founder of the Slavic Federation, which he sees as a necessary step towards human progress."

 #eurasia_event.1.t: "The State of Eurasia"
 #eurasia_event.1.d: "To: President Vadim Kozlov\nFrom: Major General Vasily\nSubject: Situation Report 486\n\nDear President Kozlov,\nOur worst fears have been confirmed. For the first time since your inauguration last year, we have been able to restore power to the central line in Moscow. Communications are (mostly) back online, and we finally have limited information on our own people. Suffice to say, things aren't pretty.\nThe Core Cities, previously considered to be the strongholds of our regime, have deteriorated in both brick and spirit. Skyscrapers are abandoned, the suburbs are controlled by bandits, while gang warfare claims hundreds of lives every day. Although your position in §RREDACTED§! is secure, returning the government to Moscow right now would be a foolish move. I suggest using local divisions to storm hostile fortresses, clear out the bandits, and restore order to the Core Cities before even considering the rest of the country.\n\nWe can also call upon corporations based in the capital. Specifically, both University and Pavlov Energy field mercenary battalions that can assist our ground assaults to retake the city. Once the anarchists are pushed back to the suburbs, we can resort to surgical bombardment to pacify the region."

 #eurasia_event.2.d: "To: President Vadim Kozlov\nFrom: Major General Strelkov\nSubject: Situation Report 528\n\nDear President Kozlov,\nI am pleased to inform you that, as of 3:00 this afternoon, the Eurasian flag was raised from the shelled ruins of the Kremlin. Our forces, led by the 324th Infantry Brigade, entered the city under heavy fire from the rooftops. Local gangs seem to have gotten word of our invasion, and we were met with great resistance. After two failed attempts at taking Eurasia Square, our armored units outflanked enemy pillboxes and broke through their support lines.\n\nCut off from their suburban storehouses, hostile elements were forced to retreat into the skyscrapers, which we attacked with nerve gas. Gang leaders surrendered afterwards, but fighting didn't stop until the last dissident was slain. Moscow is ours once again!"

 #keeper_kazan:0 "The Keeper of Kazan"
 #keeper_kazan_desc:0 "Perhaps the most receptive of the major warlords, the Keeper of Kazan rose to prominence following the Central Asian Campaign of 2154. During the Great Rout and detachment of Army Group South, the Keeper and his unit fell back to the city of Kazan, where order had collapsed following an influx of refugees from the South. Through harsh but fair means, the Keeper is believed to have solidified control in 2176, ruling the city and its surrounding farmland. Nowadays, order is maintained through raw force, but gang warfare continues to be a major issue in the region.\n\nThe Keeper of Kazan is supplied by the Lesser Moscow Department of Armaments, and utilizes a recruiting system based on gifts and favors. Past experiences, such as the destruction of adjacent bandit strongholds, have forged a bond between the Keeper and Moscow - top generals believe that, if the Keeper's demands for autonomy are fulfilled, he will allow the Union State to hoist its banner over Kazan once more."

 #comrade_komi_desc:0 "The Komi region was the center of a mass industrialization effort before the Great Mistake. Urbanization had peaked in the late 2050s, resulting in a large, unruly population, prone to crippling strikes. During the Dark Ages, one Yuri Bogdanovich led a worker uprising, slicing the entire Northeast away from the State's control. To make matters worse, anarchy and the collapse of internal trade led to mass starvation in Komi, dwindling the region's population by millions.\n\nBodganovich's successor, the Comrade of Komi, took control no more than three decades ago. His superior charisma effectively marshalled the population into a frenzy, which has resulted in multiple "witch-hunts" against bandit holdouts. Komi remains one of the State's poorest regions, and few dare to venture there without an armed escort. The Comrade has not responded to our calls for reintegration, but this may be due to faulty communication lines.\n\n§RPeaceful integration with Komi will prevent peaceful integration of Nenets and Perm.§!"

The Nenets region is home to a robust fishing industry, but has recently suffered from the Comrade of Komi's attacks upon their Southern settlements. Local militias are well equipped with our weapons, but are reluctant to accept full reintegration right now.\n\nThe fishing communities export their monthly catch across the Union State, helping to feed thousands that we cannot. It is imperative that the Nenets region be returned to the fold.\n\n§RPeaceful integration with Nenets will prevent peaceful integration of Komi.§!"
