    SOV_fires_of_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia is burning. The Great Mistake has not only flooded the Vorkuta region but wiped entire cities off the map. The Caspian's sudden expansion shattered the Central Asian campaign of 2154, cutting off our nation's access to Asia. Entire steppes are catching fire, while warlord remnants continue to harass those who dare venture outside the Core Cities. Restoring Siberia to its former beauty is an impossible task, but we can still try and salvage what is left."
    SOV_centralized_military_desc:0 "The Eurasian Military, composed of the Army, Navy, Air and Space branches, is very young. Most soldiers are veterans of the Dark Ages, and many are still loyal to local warlords. Recent efforts to centralize the military around the "Verhuvnaya Commanda", based in the capital, have not been as successful as hoped. It would be naive to believe that the ragged men we call "soldiers" have anything but money in mind. All future campaigns should be executed quickly, lest the officers decide to switch loyalties."
    SOV_slavic_federation_desc:0 "The Slavic Federation is less of a unitary entity and more of an alliance of convenience. Eurasia, still viewing itself as the protector of "junior" Slavic peoples, sends out regular relief aid to other members. While a uniting force amongst our peoples, conservative elements of society argue for a more aggressive approach towards exerting foreign influence and believe that the Federation is more of a liability than a strength.\n\nBeing Kozlov's brainchild, he is unlikely to give it up, but there are rumors of growing discontent amongst its members."

    SOV_vadim_kozlov:0 "Vadim Kozlov"
    SOV_vadim_kozlov_desc:0 "The most celebrated cosmonaut since Yuri Gagarin, Vadim Kozlov came from a working-class family but rose to heroic stature in the years following the Dark Ages.\n\nEldest son of parents who labored as itinerant steelworkers and welders, Vadim acquired his limited formal education in industrial cities scattered across the Federation. Inducted into the armed forces and immediately given the rank of Colonel, Vadim took advantage of part-time educational programs to gain a comp-diploma in aerospace engineering. Over the next decade, he became the public face of the Federation efforts to exploit the vast resources of space.\n\nIncredibly popular among the working class, a devoted family man, and fiercely loyal to the Slavic state that had rewarded his hard work, Kozlov eschewed offers to enter politics or move into the civilian realm. Vadim Kozlov is the founder of the Slavic Federation, which he sees as a necessary step towards human progress."

  #eurasia_event.1.t: "The State of Eurasia"
  #eurasia_event.1.d: "To: President Vadim Kozlov\nFrom: Major General Vasily\nSubject: Situation Report 486\n\nDear President Kozlov,\nOur worst fears have been confirmed. For the first time since your inauguration last year, we have been able to restore power to the central line in Moscow. Communications are (mostly) back online, and we finally have limited information on our own people. Suffice to say, things aren't pretty.\nThe Core Cities, previously considered to be the strongholds of our regime, have deteriorated in both brick and spirit. Skyscrapers are abandoned, the suburbs are controlled by bandits, while gang warfare claims hundreds of lives every day. Although your position in §RREDACTED§! is secure, returning the government to Moscow right now would be a foolish move. I suggest using local divisions to storm hostile fortresses, clear out the bandits, and restore order to the Core Cities before even considering the rest of the country.\n\nWe can also call upon corporations based in the capital. Specifically, both University and Pavlov Energy field mercenary battalions that can assist our ground assaults to retake the city. Once the anarchists are pushed back to the suburbs, we can resort to surgical bombardment to pacify the region."
  #eurasia_event_option.1.a: "S nami bog!"
  #eurasia_event.2.t: "The State of Moscow"
  #eurasia_event.2.d: "To: President Vadim Kozlov\nFrom: Major General Strelkov\nSubject: Situation Report 528\n\nDear President Kozlov,\nI am pleased to inform you that, as of 3:00 this afternoon, the Eurasian flag was raised from the shelled ruins of the Kremlin. Our forces, led by the 324th Infantry Brigade, entered the city under heavy fire from the rooftops. Local gangs seem to have gotten word of our invasion, and we were met with great resistance. After two failed attempts at taking Eurasia Square, our armored units outflanked enemy pillboxes and broke through their support lines.\n\nCut off from their suburban storehouses, hostile elements were forced to retreat into the skyscrapers, which we attacked with nerve gas. Gang leaders surrendered afterwards, but fighting didn't stop until the last dissident was slain. Moscow is ours once again!"
  #eurasia_event_option.2.a: "Moscow is behind us!"
  eurasia_event.3.t: "Unrest In The West"
  eurasia_event.3.d: "Ever since the incorporation of old Belarus into Russia following the Great Mistake, the Vostoslavic peoples have lived under the Eurasian yoke. An unholy conglomerate of Belorussian, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, German, Baltic, and other nationalities, the Vostoslav has been a thorn in Moscow’s politics for years, never fully accepting integration into Eurasia, but declining all provocations for a futile revolt. Eurasia, itself beset on all sides by economic problems and engaged in Eastern quagmires, never truly succeeded in enforcing its national identity upon Vostaslavia. In fact, extensive attempts at propaganda and cultural conversion, done primarily via reworked school curriculums and (for a short while) mandatory adult reeducation classes, only led to a rise in regional nationalism. Radical Vostaslavs, inspired by figures such as Maxim Veliki and Oscar Sambuk, instead adopted an ideology that promotes pan-Slavism. Recent turmoil in Moscow has allowed these subversive groups to spread out, pushing entire garrisons out of cities and revealing just how unprepared Eurasia is for an armed uprising. Garrisons in Minsk have fled to the East, with everything West of the old border effectively under rebel control."
  eurasia_event_option.3.a: "Send more garrisons immediately!"
  eurasia_event.4.t: "The Vostaslavian Spring"
  eurasia_event.4.d: "It seems that the thin garrison in the West has finally buckled under pressure. Suffering from a series of defeats at the hands of Vostaslavian guerillas near Minsk, the Eurasian soldiers hoped to create a defensive line along the old border, but were forced to call a general retreat after a scrap tank battalion threatened to cut them off from the rest of Eurasia.\n\nWith the entirety of Old Belarus under their control, the Vostaslavians have hastily organized a provisional government in their ancestral capital of Minsk. Satellite reports confirm that not all is well, however, and the rebels are prone to infighting. Already, probe teams report that the radical wings of the Vostaslavians have been rounding up Eurasians and political opponents. Fires have broken out amidst some villages, and there are rumors that weaponized anthrax was accidentally released into the countryside during the Fall of Minsk (our scientists, however, assure us that no such bioweapon existed outside the Core). Unfortunately, we are too preoccupied with petty warlords and the Karelians to launch a full invasion. Furthermore, doing so might provoke the Germans, who are expected to capitalise on the situation soon. Our units are currently regrouping and reinforcements from New St.Petersburg are en-route."

  eurasia_event.6.t: "Chaos In Karelia"
  eurasia_event.6.d: "Our probe teams in Karelia are reporting general commotion in Onega and Murmansk. It seems that the Karelian Duma, the governing body of the rogue state, has been overthrown in a near bloodless coup by a union of Finnish nationalists and Russian dissidents. The new government has promised to continue the democratic traditions of the old regime, and has also announced the abandonment of all claims on our country. Karelia (or as it now refers to itself, Karjala) is still too weak and unstable to join another alliance within a few years, which should give us enough time to intervene and reclaim the region, or engage in some kind of diplomatic effort. We still don’t have an embassy in Karjala, but that can be remedied soon enough. Either way, we have effectively secured the Northern border." #without firing a shot!"
  eurasia_event_option.6.a: "Well that’s a relief."
  eurasia_event.7.t: "Intervention in the Balkan-Romanian war"
  eurasia_event.7.d: "The Balkan Peninsula was always a troublesome place, before and after the Great Mistake. Russia historically had followed Pan-Slavism even during their time as a monarchy, and Serbia always was our ally. As history went on, our states have collapsed and risen, but our people have stood side by side nonetheless. This time is not an exception. Serbia had formed the Balkan Federation, once again embracing our shared goal of Pan-Slavism - we had pursued closer ties ever since, albeit we weren't able to make them a part of our alliance. Now we have the chance to do so, and an obligation to back them up. Balkan Federation had entered a war against Romania, a tyrannical sham democracy governing an artificial country. Supporting The Federation won't just give us a powerful ally and control of almost all the Peninsula; it will also be our first step to becoming a true great power and achieving geopolitical reference. Now, we should determine the scale of our intervention. It is a double-edged sword - the more we support The Balkan Federation, the more likely it is that they will succeed. But also, we will receive diplomatic backlash and consequences according to our involvement."
  eurasia_event_option.7.a: "Do nothing..."

  eurasia_event.8.t: "Disaster In Vorkuta"
  eurasia_event.8.d: "The condition of the Vorkuta region grows more dire every day, and now it has taken yet another step towards its destruction with the latest large-scale flood sweeping through the territory, destroying any civilian structure in its wake, annihilating the densely populated slums. Casualties are estimated to be in the thousands, with the displaced in the hundreds of thousands. /n/n The failure (and possible inability) of our state to prevent this calamity has drawn international ire, and the almost nonexistent response provided led to some claiming that the Vorkuta territories should be given greater care by our government- or entrusted to another country entirely."
  eurasia_event_option.8.a: "We cannot allow this to happen again."
  eurasia_event.9.t: "Riots in the Capital"
  eurasia_event.9.d: "A small assembly of sensible protestors, probably some unremarkable Baltic political group, gathering in the streets of (Capital) were soon followed by a fairly large group of less-reasonable dissidents, which inevitably drew in an upsetting number of angry, unconsolable rioters. /n/n Responders, either medical, judicial, or military, found it almost impossible to contain the chaos, and some of the more bloodthirsty of the dissenting masses met their match in the eager batons among our own police corps.\n\nUltimately the mob dissolved in the face of armored forces and the severe injury or departure of the original protestors, leaving little reason for the dissidents to remain. Unconsolable rioters, ever detracting, were secreted away in unmarked vehicles.\n\nThe media have already begun a cycle change to wipe away the riot’s memory, but no amount of induced ignorance can restore a burned building or silence opportunistic foreign reporting."
  eurasia_event_option.9.a: "Protest to riot to revolution. Snipped in the bud, strangled in the crib."
  eurasia_event.10.t: "Occult Cataclysm"
  eurasia_event.10.d: "There is no shortage of preachers, prophets, messiahs and madmen within our own borders, but recently some deranged foreigner has led a strange procession of pilgrims through the streets of the devastated Vortuka region. Her sierred followers grew in number through each backwater town they trudged by, until they reached the northern shores of our country, without her uttering a word.\n\nAt this point, about 10,000 men, women, and children stood beside the stranger, most of which were among the displaced and homeless population of our nation, and as countless more were watching from a distance or through a screen, the woman removed her plain hood to reveal her face to the people.\n\nA great gaping wound, untreated and unclean, ran diagonally from her left eye to across her mouth, filled with pus, rotted flesh, and opportunistic larvae. Any remaining facial muscles twitched before she turned to the sea and nonchalantly walked into the freezing waters until she could no longer be seen.\n\nFor reasons still indecipherable to our state psychologists, with guesses ranging from total apathy, unfathomable feelings of hopelessness, and a lead deposit recently unearthed by flooding, the amassed followers began to wander into the ocean themselves. Babies were clutched tight to the chests of their descending mothers, while children were led by the hand of their fathers who, unceremoniously and silently, drowned without struggling.\n\nThe event was horrific to those who witnessed it firsthand, and greatly disturbing to the millions who have seen the recordings distributed online. Commentators simply stared in abject shock as they streamed the event. Reporters, for the first time in years, could only watch in silence as they played the video on their broadcast. Likewise, our administration has yet to make a statement on the issue."
  eurasia_event_option.10.a: "Bodies continue to wash up along the shore, but we have yet to find a trace of the wounded woman."
  eurasia_event.11.t: "Livestream Chaos"
  eurasia_event.11.d: "A fairly popular ‘hemmoroidcore’ band known as ‘Untreated_Mental_Illness72’ held a concert in an abandoned steel mill on the outskirts of a town in our Ukrainian territories. While initially unremarkable, culture monitors began to report potential calls for riots in what passes for the band’s lyrics. As an increasing number of civilians watched the event online via unregistered livestreams and in person, the songs played grew more obscene. Eventually, the lead singer called for “total revolution”, and slit his own throat.\n\nDespite the quick responce of enforcers to the scene to contain the masses, the online audience was spread throughout Eurasia, running outside of their dilapidated apartments, vandalizing and rioting to the best of their ability, usually ending in a murder-suicide. The cases were often among the more impoverished and ostracized members of our nation, and the initial chaos and confusion resulted in increased polarization between ethnic groups.\n\n‘Hemmoroidcore’ and related genres have been banned from all public and private stations and music outlets. State psychologists are actively studying the cause (and potential applications) of the aggressive outburst. For now, the people remain frightened, disturbed, and untrustworthy of our ability to govern."
  eurasia_event_option.11.a: "To watch the world burn…"
  eurasia_event.12.t: "Mass Collapse"
  eurasia_event.12.d: "Occupied by a jobless colony, an ancient, dilapidated series of apartment complexes dating back to the USSR (and possibly earlier) somewhere around the southern borders were already on the verge of collapse. Makeshift rebar reinforcements and wooden extensions constructed by the mostly unemployed locals attempted to prolong the lifespan of the almost unusable structures, but they ultimately failed as the corner foundation of one of the largest buildings cracked apart due to a gas main exploding, causing layer after layer to crumble.\n\nWorse, the building did not collapse downwards, but sideways, slamming into the neighboring apartments, sending rubble and rebar flying in every direction. Whatever structures survived the ‘domino effect of death’ as the more sensational tabloid accounts called it were full of holes and littered with debris and dead bodies.\n\nSome survivors, as they helped themselves and one another free of the ruins, tried to determine what caused the collapse. Many feared it was a terrorist attack, and when one man claimed to have heard a man shouting a war cry in some Balkan language before the explosion, and so the claim became an accusation, and the accusation turned into a brawl. The explosion of ethnic, cultural, and religious tension among the former tenants was live-streamed to hundreds of thousands.\n\nEventually, those that were not impaled by rebar or crushed by concrete would kill each other with whatever rubble was closest. Nurture networks have failed to prevent the violence from spreading further in areas neighboring the region."
  eurasia_event_option.12.a: "Update the unemployment statistics."
  eurasia_event.13.t: "Death of a Preacher"
  eurasia_event.13.d: "A beloved priest belonging to a church in our capital committed suicide by package drone yesterday, much to the despair and sadness of our more religious population. While at first confused and greatly disturbed, their emotions turned to displeasure when an otherwise unremarkable politician in our administration made a handful of problematic comments on the event. Later that day, as the politician was accosted from a distance in his father’s summer home, one citizen drew an unregistered firearm in an attempt on the public servant’s life.\n\nFortunately, an off-duty protest infiltration officer among the crowd was able to snap the woman’s neck before they fired. This escalated into further harm as off-duty riot control police suppressed the violently fleeing mob. Once off-duty armored personnel carriers had arrived, the people had dissipated, but with one of the more popular shopping districts now littered with trash and former citizens, there were only further complaints on public forums and internationally.\n\nThe politician (who was unharmed) has moved to the premises of his mother’s lakehouse as he recovers, and a small stipend was offered to his family."
  eurasia_event_option.13.a: "That was a close one."

  #keeper_kazan:0 "The Keeper of Kazan"
  #keeper_kazan_desc:0 "Perhaps the most receptive of the major warlords, the Keeper of Kazan rose to prominence following the Central Asian Campaign of 2154. During the Great Rout and detachment of Army Group South, the Keeper and his unit fell back to the city of Kazan, where order had collapsed following an influx of refugees from the South. Through harsh but fair means, the Keeper is believed to have solidified control in 2176, ruling the city and its surrounding farmland. Nowadays, order is maintained through raw force, but gang warfare continues to be a major issue in the region.\n\nThe Keeper of Kazan is supplied by the Lesser Moscow Department of Armaments, and utilizes a recruiting system based on gifts and favors. Past experiences, such as the destruction of adjacent bandit strongholds, have forged a bond between the Keeper and Moscow - top generals believe that, if the Keeper's demands for autonomy are fulfilled, he will allow the Union State to hoist its banner over Kazan once more."

 #POLITICS_YANKOV_DANILOVICH_DESC:0 "Yankov Danilovich was never a fan of the University. No amount of propaganda for the "greater good" could convince him that the skeletons in the State's closet were worth it. Yankov attended Moscow University during the warlord period, during which time he was credited with defending the building from bandits. This action led Yankov to being conscripted during the Belorussian Insurrection, where he participated in a BioWeapons unit. Witnessing the horrors of modern warfare firsthand, Yankov began identifying as a pacifist. By the war's conclusion, his inventions netted over 2,000 combat kills, which he denounced as "my evil inventions".\n\nAfter the war, Yankov returned to Moscow University, only to find readmission locked behind a high fee. It was only through the Prokhor's notice of Yankov's abilities was he able to return to his studies. Once the University began to encompass all scientific institutions in the Federation, Yankov had gained enough support among its students so as to form the "Reformist" wing, arguing for strict ethical limits on research, but also started a failed petition to isolate the University from military activities. Now, Yankov Danilovich finds himself at Eurasia's helm, and he vows to never repeat the atrocities of war."
 #POLITICS_STRELKOV_DMITRIEVICH_DESC:0 "A child of the Dark Ages, Strelkov was the diamond in the coal. During the warlord times, Eurasia's armies consisted of untrained conscripts, rushed to the front in a desperate attempt to maintain control over the Core Cities. All trained soldiers, veterans of the Central Asian Campaign, fought under warlords. Strelkov was one of the few officers who always stood by Eurasia, and has been credited with destroying over two dozen warlord bands.\n\nNow, Strelkov leads a loose coalition of army units who look to the past for guidance. The Slavic Federation, in their opinion, is a symbol of weakness, its members plagued by decadence. Strelkov, alongside notable commanders like The Titan, have been too powerful for previous governments to quell, and now that Strelkov's clique has taken control over Eurasia, the rest of the world quakes in fear. Russia is back, and Europe is in the crosshairs."
 #POLITICS_YUG_COMMAND_DESC:0 "The remnants of Army Group South have no real leader. A variety of petty generals, warlords, and raiders preside over their tiny domains. The strongest of this force is Yug Army Command, surviving in the Ural Mountain range. Comprised of aging officers and disgruntled veterans, Command nonetheless wields the largest organized force in the region. It also maintains a direct communications line with Moscow, and is nominally allowed to patrol the Urals."
 #POLITICS_PROKHOR_ZAKHAROV_DESC:0 "Prokhor Zakharov was born in the city of Cherskiy, Russia, during the Dark Ages. His father was a businessman and politician, but early exposure to the corruption of post-Mistake society led the young Zakharov to reject such a "worldly" career. Instead, he pursued an education in the sciences, earning his first degree from the University of Moscow at the age of 18 (largely through Interlink correspondence courses). He then joined the Russian Defense Force, where he exhibited an exceptional aptitude for physics and engineering, sent to the University of Moscow on-site for Masters in engineering. During the warlord period, the Russian Far East was the site of civil unrest and border skirmishes with the Chinese refugees. Zakharov served as a combat engineer in these conflicts, earning a reputation for radical innovation under stressful conditions.\n\nCognitive ability exceedingly high; genius level. Worldview driven almost exclusively through logic. Poor ethical judgment and inability to weigh in emotional factors; moderate deficiency in social functioning. Puts strong reliance on tools and his ability to use and adapt them; this, over human values, represents ultimate good. Ability to work as part of a team towards definable goals invaluable to mission, but poorly defined sense of ethics and tendency toward self-aggrandizement must be closely monitored by ranking superior."
