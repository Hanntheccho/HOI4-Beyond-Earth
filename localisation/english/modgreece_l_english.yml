 GRE_heart_of_old_athens:0 "Heart Of Old Athens"
 GRE_heart_of_old_athens_desc:0 "Greece is home to one of the oldest civilizations on the European continent. Its people are the proud owners of a rich history that spans entire millenniums. The ruins of long dead rulers overshadow the modern network nodes and high-tech construction facilities. Schools teach ancient history alongside augmentation, and whatever small tourism industry still exists in Europe has been virtually monopolized by Greece. The mountainous terrain of this nation has also allowed it to survive the floods of water and refugees, leaving it in a position of relative strength."
