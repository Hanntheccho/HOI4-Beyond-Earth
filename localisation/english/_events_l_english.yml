  generic_event.1.t: "Mobilization Law"
  generic_event.1.d: "Our government has approached the controversial topic of making amendments to our laws and shifting our industry regarding imminent conflict. Times are turbulent, and the subject of mobilizing our nation is not one that often sits well with the people. Should we decide to mobilize, we should hope for popular support for our government if we want to avoid backlash. Alternatively, lowering our mobilization will be a widely crowd-pleasing move towards peace, and will hopefully help us muster further support. If we do not expect conflict, that is."
  generic_event_option.1.a: "Intensify our mobilization laws."
  generic_event_option.1.b: "The laws will stay as they are."
  generic_event_option.1.c: "Soften our intensity of mobilization."
  generic_event.2.t: "Economic Law"
  generic_event.2.d: "For as long as there has been government, people have argued about the economy. Now it is our turn, as our government approaches our stance on the issue. Advocates of a centralized economy site the benefits of central planning and optimized control, whereas advocates of a decentralized economy cite the individuality of the market and greater creation of opportunity for business. We will never please everyone, especially not when the economy is involved, but we must pick the direction we think will work best."
  generic_event_option.2.a: "We must further centralize the economy."
  generic_event_option.2.b: "The economy will stay as it is for now."
  generic_event_option.2.c: "The economy must become more decentralized."
  generic_event.3.t: "Trade Law"
  generic_event.3.d: "Trade is a vital part of any economy, as much as any nation would love nothing more than to be totally self-sufficient. It is the balance between these two subjects that has come to our attention. An economy focused on exports and imports would allow us to have a more varied system and to increase overall profits, whereas a closed economy will reserve the nation's resources for our own use, rather than selling them off to others."
  generic_event_option.3.a: "Tighten up trade and focus around a more closed economy."
  generic_event_option.3.b: "Trade laws may stay unchanged."
  generic_event_option.3.c: "Loosen up restrictions and allow for greater trade."

  news_event.11.t: "Welcome to the 23rd Century!"
  news_event.11.d: "3! 2! 1! Happy New Year! The clocks across the planet rang out in momentous joy as the streets were filled with the emotional jubilation of a brand-new century. Champagne corks popped in unison and celebration roared across the entire human race. Everyone from the lowly grain-farmer to the multimillionaire executive was now cheering an event that comes once in almost every lifetime. \n\nBeginning in the Pacific, midnight swept westwards, endowing delight but also relief in billions across the world. This was an awfully special centennial for most. The previous century had brought nothing but pain and death. In an almost biblical myth, the world was ravaged by conquests, warfare, famine, and general death. The seas had risen so high that entire cities were swallowed. Traditional governments had been slashed apart by the needs of the masses. Diseases, new and old, had poisoned so many, eliminated entire nations. The number dead... a soul-crushing statistic. Now, these people could finally let go of some of their pent-up grief.\n\nTears, not smiles, were the most common sight on New Year's Day. Humanity had suffered and the planet had suffered with them. But, finally, after so long, things were beginning to look up. Space exploration has become a glorious and achievable prospect. Human ingenuity has eased much of the unnecessary pain that plagued so many. And, although she has many scars, mother nature seems to be in a relatively stable condition.\n\nThe future is bright as long as we continue to reach for those bright, hopeful stars.\n\n§CWelcome to the 23rd Century, gentlemen.§!"

  news_event.12.t: "The State of the Church"
  news_event.12.d: "The Catholic Church was once the largest religious group in the world throughout the past several centuries. It has had a history of splits, rivalries and rebellions, including the Great Schism, which led to the creation of the Orthodox Churches, and the Protestant Reformation, which established several new reformed churches such as Lutherans, Calvinists, and Presbyterians, to name a few. Despite the events of the past, the Catholic Church still stood strong in the world, triumphing over almost every obstacle it faced. But once again, the history repeats itself. Catholicism splits once more.\n\nThe "Old" Papacy, located in South America, claims to be the true spearhead of what the Church was always supposed to mean: humanity and solidarity, while keeping Catholic teachings alive and a decentralized power structure.\n\nThe "New" Papacy, located in the reborn, historical city of Avignon, has always made the effort of overcoming change while keeping its conservative values and centralized power structure. It has come under scrutiny and criticism for being the most stagnant branch of the Church in an effort to keep the traditional idea of the Church alive, favouring the ruling elite and accepting the patronage and assistance of leaders favourable to this entity, while also criticising the Old Papacy for not being true Catholics.\n\nThis has been known as the “Second Great Schism”."

  news_event.13.t: "The Third Millennium Eurotunnel"
  news_event.13.d: "The first version of the Eurotunnel was completed in 1994, more than two centuries ago, crossing the English Channel and thus linking the former France and the old United Kingdom.\n\nIt was the longest stretch of underwater railway in the world, allowing crossing from the continent to the island in less than 40 minutes. The machinery used in its construction amounted to 1,100 tonnes, with the capacity to drill 20 kilometres without interruption. 16 billion euros from private companies financed the project.\n\nBut the progress of science and of these European powers made it possible to develop drilling techniques far more effective than any that had got before. Thanks to the progress of the Scottish mining industry, cooperating with the English government and largely with funding from France (later Franco-Iberian) a much larger capacity tunnel was completed: the Third Millennium Eurotunnel.\n\nThis tunnel has the capacity for four maglev rail tracks, two in each direction, and a four-space motorway. Millions of people travel through these tunnels every month, connecting the two countries as never before.\n\nIf you are interested in travelling from Oxford to Paris you can get a maglev ticket now, it won't take more than an hour.\n\nIn fact if you think deeply about it, it would take you more time packing up than actually travelling!"

  news_event.14.t: "The ISS Development"
  news_event.14.d: "In a historic display of international cooperation, nations from around the world joined forces to build the largest spaceship ever created. Dubbed "Unity," the massive vessel is set to embark on a groundbreaking journey to explore the farthest reaches of our galaxy.\n\nConstruction of the ISS-Unity has been, and is, a massive undertaking, requiring unprecedented levels of collaboration and coordination between nations. Teams of scientists, engineers, and builders from countries including Franco-Iberia, People's Republic of China, Eurasia, and the EAF keep working tirelessly to bring the ambitious project to fruition.\n\nAt a press conference held today, leaders from the participating nations gathered to celebrate the planned completion of the ISS-Unity construction and announce the launch date for its maiden voyage. Speaking to a packed room of journalists and dignitaries, Franco-Iberian President Élodie praised the cooperation of all involved.\n\n"Today we celebrate not just the construction of a great ship, but the strength of our shared vision and determination," President Élodie said. "The ISS-Unity is a testament to what we can achieve when we work together."\n\nThe spaceship, which measures a staggering +1 kilometer in length, is equipped with cutting-edge technology that will allow it to explore previously uncharted territories. Its crew of over 2,000 will spend decades traveling through space, collecting data and conducting experiments that could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and help us all find a new home.\n\nAs the launch date for the ISS-Unity draws near, excitement and anticipation are building among scientists and space enthusiasts around the world. Many are calling the project a new era in space exploration and a shining example of international collaboration at its finest."
  news_event_option.14.a: "Interesting! We should contribute too."
  news_event.15.t: "The WCRB-Lua Colony"
  news_event.15.d: "Known as the "The Swiss Plebiscite" and taking place in the year 2107, Old Switzerland was split between Italy, France, and Germany through a combination of economic and political pressures. Despite famines and economic shortcomings, Switzerland proper remained largely unaffected by the Great Mistake, making it the envy of the crippled powers of Europe.\n\nDuring the Dark Ages, many extraterrestrial projects were abandoned due to a lack of funding, with the "Mars Tragedy" being the most well-known. The WCRB-Lua Moon Colony was founded by the Swiss as a tourist destination in 2074. Old flight plans put the colony's population at roughly 40 people. Post-Mistake rescue attempts were seen as unfeasible and, for most of the 22nd century, the colony was thought lost forever.\n\nHowever, German scientists have recently noticed subtle signs that WCRB-Lua has survived. Some parts of the scientific community have argued that the colonists must have survived in stasis, while others have dismissed the notion as mere conjecture.\n\nFortunately, due to high popular support for the expedition, and to test humanity's spaceborne capacities, the German Federation has authorized the Roter-Mond Mission. Scheduled to be carried out next month, international treaties have already been signed to avoid complications and INTEGR sympathizers worldwide have convened to express their support. The Swiss region itself, an autonomous part of Germany, is planning a nation-wide celebration. Thousands are expected to attend and watch the operation unfold."
  news_event_option.15.a: "There is something wrong..."
  news_event.16.t: "End of an Age"
  news_event.16.d: "Many historians around the globe have named specific periods of modern history after the superpower that characterized them. The 19th and early 20th centuries were the "British Century"; the decades between the Second World War and the Great Mistake were the "American Century"; and the last hundred years have been collectively referred to as the "Chinese Century". Despite the breakdown of global interactions, the People's Republic of China had expanded its influence across much of Asia while its biggest competitors fractured. Even today, China controls some of the world's most productive and densely populated regions. On multiple occasions, statisticians have deduced that no continent, with the possible exception of Africa, is competitive with China on an economic and military level.\n\nHowever, as the old saying would have it, a China long united must divide. Whether the product of destiny or human error, China has been gradually receding from international politics. Non-intervention in Siberia, the informal exit of the Central Asian Federation from its sphere of influence, and a dramatic decrease in annual scientific breakthroughs has been enough to convince many political theorists of China's decline. It can be said that the following century, if there will be one left once the decade is through, will belong not to the People's Republic of China or a sole region, but rather to a multipolar world. Although China divulges little information about its interior politics, satellites have reported mass troops movement within the country. Some argue that the country is headed straight for a civil war, while others believe that this is the beginning of a massive Chinese expansion across the Eurasian landmass. Whatever the case, it is now nigh undeniable that China is no longer the same power that it was almost a century ago."

  news_event.17.t: "War in Europe"
  news_event.17.d: "In a turn of events all too familiar to local history, the continent of Europe is once again consumed by bloodshed as war erupts between its most influential powers.\n\nIn a flurry of declarations and counter-declarations, the forces of Franco-Iberia, Germany, the North Sea and Eurasia are now on the march. For years, these powers have vied for control of the divided continent, seeking any opportunity to gain influence and resources in the post-EU landscape. The vicious civil war in England was the first domino to fall in earnest, seeing internationally-backed rebel groups assail the crumbling pro-North Sea Alliance regime in a thinly-veiled proxy conflict. In the years since, various civil and regional conflicts across the continent have become the frontlines for grand plans of pan-European politics and identity. Now far from hollow talk in the great capitals of Europe, these plans are being made manifest on the continent’s newfound battlefields.\n\nWhile the move comes as a shock to many, international observers have long warned of an escalation to the region’s ideological disputes. Although Europe emerged from the Dark Days in far better shape than many areas, that is not saying much given global conditions. The continent lost much of its coastal infrastructure just like the rest of the world, while domestic and international refugee crises had a profound effect on the region’s politics. The collapse of the European Union was perhaps the hallmark moment, seemingly bringing an end to the dream of European unity.\n\nBut the ember of that dream still flickers. And now, the outcome of the war it has sparked may forever determine the fate of the restless continent."
  news_event_option.17.a: "The lamps are going out all over Europe."
  news_event.18.t: "The Fourth American Civil War"
  news_event.18.d: "In a turn of events that would once be deemed impossible, America finds itself in the grips of yet another civil war.\n\nThe long-faltering North American Union now faces uprisings on numerous fronts, including splinter groups within its ranks. Various local insurgencies have also emerged declaring various causes, from Christian nationhood to the restoration of the United Nations. The American Reclamation Corporation has even been reported to have made its move, with the megacorporation having assumed such a position within North American politics that it can actively challenge the NAU militarily.\n\nBut perhaps the most audacious reports are coming from the Eastern Seaboard, where the remnants of the old United States Navy have mobilized for an invasion of District 3. While its forces are small and outdated, the remnants of what was once Earth’s mightiest navy have demonstrated considerable endurance surviving its exile. And with District 3 divided between NAU forces, ARC mercenaries and descendants of the last UN peacekeepers, there is a slim but possible chance that the stars and stripes will once more fly over the continent.\n\nRegardless, this conflict marks the beginning of a new chapter in America’s bloody post-Mistake history. While its first civil war was fought over slavery in the 19th century, the second was a product of the Great Mistake. As the skies darkened and the seas rose, the US government’s failure to contain the situation led to a military coup that would form the similarly outmatched North American Union. A later attempt to displace the NAU during the third civil war failed, but only pushed the once-proud nation further down the road to decline.\n\nWhoever emerges victorious from this struggle will have a mighty task ahead of them if they wish to restore America to the height of the former United States. While this may yet be another milestone in America’s fall from grace, there remains hope on the ground that America – in one form or another – will arise once more, soaring high from the ashes like a phoenix."
  news_event_option.18.a: "The house divided has fallen."
  news_event.19.t: "The Antarctica"
  news_event.19.d: "In a major development for the global economy, several countries have recently made significant investments in the industrial sectors of Antarctica. The resource-rich continent, long considered one of the last frontiers for exploration and development, has become a major focus for countries seeking to gain an edge in the race for natural resources.\n\nAt the forefront of this push is the People's Republic of China, which has announced plans to build a massive mining operation in Antarctica's interior. The project, which is set to begin construction later this year, will be the largest of its kind ever attempted in the region, with the capacity to extract billions of tons of valuable minerals and metals.\n\nOther countries, including Eurasia, Franco-Iberia, and Westralia, have also expressed interest in expanding their industrial presence in Antarctica. With its vast reserves of iron, copper, and other precious resources, the continent has become a hotbed of competition for nations seeking to secure access to these vital materials.\n\nBut the push for industrial development in Antarctica has not been without controversy. Environmentalists and conservationists have raised concerns about the potential impact of mining and other industrial activities on the fragile ecosystem of the region. They argue that increased human activity could disrupt delicate ecological systems, causing irreparable damage to the continent's unique flora and fauna.\n\nDespite these concerns, many governments and corporations are pushing ahead with plans for resource extraction in Antarctica. As the competition for these valuable materials heats up, it remains to be seen how the delicate balance between industrial development and environmental preservation will be maintained."

Due to the difficulty in ascending spaceship parts into orbit, the Bridge was constructed almost entirely in space, then attached to the Unity skeleton. According to one Professor Matthews, the hardest part about making a vessel capable of traveling between the stars is the AI.\n\n"Every calculation has to be precise, but when you're involved with so many variables, it's so overwhelming for a human." Matthews explained in a recent interview, "With the AI, we have to strike a balance between it being smart enough to do all the heavy lifting for us, but also constrained enough so as not to... you know." Indeed, fears of an AI malfunction have been high ever since the passing of Professor Song in 2192, one of the pioneers behind the Unity Project and a proponent of Positronic Brains. The current spaceship AI, affectionally named "Parrot" by the orbital crews, is programmed to handle navigation, drone control, and strategic planning.

The compartments here are significantly wider that those below, so as to facilitate a more relaxed lifestyle. The next level is for ship functionaries, the ship mess hall, and the general entertainment room. An administrative and logistics office is also present on this level, as are labs and a mechanic's room.\n\nThe third level is reserved for semi-hibernating passengers, who are to be awoken every other Earth month, or on demand, for specialized tasks such as complex medical services, agricultural maintenance, and live morale support. The last level is comprised of stasis chambers and can hold up to four thousand individuals. This area also includes medical stations, an inspector's office, and crew storage compartments. The criteria for selection varies from country to country, but it is generally accepted that one has to be exceptionally skilled and renowned to be given a space on the ship. The crew quarters, with the sole exception of the top level, is overseen by a separate AI that monitors physical and mental health levels. Currently the ISS Unity is staffed by a workers' crew of roughly six hundred, but most terrestrial powers have rockets on standby to rapidly populate and launch the spaceship in case of an emergency."

The world's surviving species have been catalogued and sampled as comprehensively as deteriorating conditions allow, with a vast genetic library installed aboard the Unity for colonists to call upon. So too has a sizeable database of Earth culture - nicknamed "the Canon" by some involved in the project - been compiled in the hopes that colonists will never forget Earth even if they never return to it.\n\nWhile the essential supplies, samples and data are already onboard, an ongoing upload of less-essential cultural data is being conducted from an uplink in [FROM.Capital.GetName].

And nowhere is this more apparent than in its newly-constructed engine. \n\nDesigned by an international committee of scientists and engineers hosted by [ROOT.GetNameDef], the engine utilizes the latest advancements in fusion technology to generate thrust. This will not only apply to the Unity's departure, but also its arrival - the engine will need to decelerate the Unity as it nears its destination, reducing its speed sufficiently to allow careful manoeuvring into a planetary orbit. Failure could see the Unity overshoot its target, easily dooming the mission as the vessel is lost to deep space. It could also result in the Unity colliding with an interstellar object, or simply never reaching its destination in the first place. \n\nFuelling the engine has proven similarly challenging. In addition to fuel refined specifically for the Unity mission, the vessel will use a first-of-its-kind ramscoop to harvest hydrogen from the vacuum of space. Though very limited in effectiveness due to the prohibitively large magnetic field needed to harvest ample fuel, the ramscoop will nonetheless provide a trickle of fuel that could prove crucial should initial reserves be depleted. [ROOT.GetNameDef] is conducting ongoing testing and simulations from the engine's uplink facility in [FROM.Capital.GetName], hoping to optimize the ramscoop's effectiveness and the engine's overall fuel consumption.

It certainly did not come without warning.\n\nSince long before the Great Mistake, humanity has lived beyond its means. It has come to possess technology and industry beyond the wildest dreams of its ancestors, all while remaining just as flawed as any previous generation. The drive to survive the dangers of nature led to surpassing and ultimately growing apart from it. From the destruction of habitats for living space to the overexploitation of food sources, from the dumping of waste to the steady encroachment of climate change, humanity's connection with nature grew from symbiotic to parasitic. And despite the best efforts of those who recognized the danger, it is clear that Earth has passed its tipping point.\n\nTemperatures are rising to dangerous levels across the globe. Water supplies grow scarce and contaminated. Soil quality has declined to near uselessness. Insects and animals are dying off to the point of leaving their ecological niches all but empty. And with each of these crises come dire implications for humanity, still struggling to find its feet after the Great Mistake. The latest developments only confirms long-held fears that the Great Mistake's impacts were not only unrecoverable, but terminal.\n\nThis may not be the end for all humanity.

But it is clear that many - likely most - will not survive, and the existential weight of the Collapse has already shown itself. Riots, looting and civil unrest loom large in many nations while rates of substance abuse and suicide skyrocket. Rather than give in to despair, some now place their hopes into avenues of last resort, be they religious, scientific or political. Averting the Collapse may no longer be an option, but many will now fight for any chance at surviving it - be that on Earth or another world."

 international_news_event.13.d: "Our significant work on parts of the ISS-Unity - perceived by many to be a last hope for human redemption - gives us a strong voice in the ongoing negotiations over its development as the sensitive diplomatic discussion continues. The topic of Internationalisation is the most spirited by far; the idea that the Unity was constructed for the collective good of Humanity, and thus should fall under the jurisdiction of no single government.\n\nThis is a bitter pill to swallow for our hard work and sacrifice in its timely completion, and many are extremely hesitant to simply give up our hard work to an international body exempt from our influence, be it over perceived injustice, petty disputes or simple, human pride.\n\nIf Internationalisation goes ahead as planned, however, we may just secure humanity's future in the stars, and our story would not have to end here in the rising tides."

 international_news_event.8.t: "Together At Last"
 international_news_event.8.d: "A long time ago, there was a humble people that had just come into existence. They lived in caves, feared the elements, and subsisted on wild berries and game. Then, one day, something changed. It was not an immediate change, but the gradual product of eons. This species made fire and after that came agriculture, urbanization, tools and history. Many members of this people wrote long epics about the sadness of their condition. They spoke of a general disunity that pervaded the species, a shameless feeling that caused that caused it to be in a state of constant war against itself.\n\nThis culminated when the species grew too powerful, so powerful, that its wisdom could not catch up. It found itself on an unstoppable treadmill, running from something, but somehow stuck in one place. But now that species, which began in caves, stands on the cusp of a golden age. For better or worse, the age-old belief in division has been temporarily disproven. The peoples of that planet stand together now, in the face of entropy, and look up to the stars. Their home is dying, and they know that most will not make it. But for a rare moment, there is a general sense of acceptance. The last light of this species will soon depart for a distant planet, perhaps never to return home. Or maybe, in some unforeseeable future, the warped skies of the Motherworld will open to reveal the homecoming of a child long thought dead. Or maybe there will be nothing at all from the offspring of this species, and it will wither and die in silence."

 international_news_event.9.d: "The completion of the ISS-Unity did not go according to plan. The ship was finished, yes, but every scientist and worker in orbit felt that something was missing. Perhaps the terrestrial media underplayed the importance of the event. Perhaps the people were too busy with their own issues. There were a hundred potential reasons for the lackluster reception of the first inter-solar spaceship, but none of them really mattered. The workers coldly shook hands in front of cameras and flew back home.\n\nOn Earth, tensions continued to rise. Wars, general destruction and decay had become the order of the day. Some said that there was another Great Mistake, be it literal or spiritual, happening. But the nations and alliances of the world knew better than to waste time on petty conflicts. There is a war brewing, a final one."

Nations have begun to mobilize their reserves, but no longer bother with excuses or justifications. Popular militias and mobs are organizing, but most governments are content with letting them run amok. Frontlines are swelling with soldiers, but the media has given up on reports. Hungry crowds flock from the cities in search of food, while their countries aim the last missiles at each other. Settlements that only five years ago were bustling with activity and prosperity, are now crumbling apart. A final war is on the horizon."

 international_news_event.11.d: "Centuries ago, there were two cataclysmic wars fought across the world. They tore apart entire nations, unleashed unimaginable powers, and shaped human history. The survivors of these conflicts believed that the wars were the final ones. After all the destruction, extermination, killings and death, how could there be another war of such scale?\n\nThe Final War begins, and with it come the last hours of Earth. Human civilization, on the backfoot for centuries, now chops off slices of itself until only one side remains. Future historians, if there will be any left, shall look back to this time either with pride or disappointment. The time of learning from history is over, for nothing will stand between humanity and its survival. The first to colonize other planets will have every justification and absolution possible. Everybody else will be left at their mercy. Across the world, doors long through shut are opening, and prayers rise in vain to the stars.

 international_news_event.12.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the world's hopes for space exploration went up in flames following today's disaster. The ISS-Unity has been destroyed.\n\nMany in the international scientific community believed that the Unity's launch would pave the way for mankind's future in the stars. Sadly, this may never come to pass. Though the initial launch was successful, problems began to arise almost immediately after it began to reach supersonic speed.\n\nFrom what little information can be gathered, the Unity's systems began to ignore commands both from the ship's crew and mission control. Effort to fix this proved fruitless, and it soon became clear that the vessel had been hijacked. Less than three minutes after this, as the crew attempted to regain control, the ship malfunctioned, resulting in a complete system crash and the Unity exploding. There were no survivors. The identity of the hijacker of the Unity is unknown, and so far no nation has claimed responsibility. However, the host country has denounced this as an act of sabotage and has begun to threaten military action against those who 'threaten our scientific and technological independence'.\n\nMany now fear that this incident will set the final spark for a final war, but only time will tell if this is the case."

 international_news_event.14.d: "After tense negotiations following the completion of the ISS Unity's independent segments and uplinks by several of the world's major powers, it seems no settlement has been reached as further talks become a more and more distant possibility.\n\nBuilt to serve as a united, independent hope at a future for mankind in the stars, the ISS Unity's future has ironically been consumed by the disunity of its competing creators. Being perhaps the one lifeline humanity has left, however, none are expecting the slighted powers to back down at the failure of negotiations. Tensions are flaring dramatically, and militaries across the globe are seeing an increase in readiness.\n\nHumanity's bid for a united future has failed, and in the race for salvation, a great, Final War is upon us."
