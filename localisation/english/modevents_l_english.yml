 news_event.6.t: "Another heat wave over Europe"
 news_event.6.d: "Experts are in shock today as a record-breaking heatwave moves over Southern Europe. The system has already sparked massive wildfires in southern European countries such as the Balkan Union, Franco-Iberia and the Roman Republic with further fires expected in Padania and even further north.\n\nThe heatwave has put immense strain on the Balkan as well as Franco-Iberian and the Roman Republican populations, killing a reported 5,000 and leaving another 7,000 missing. As a result of these natural disasters, massive refugee movements north have strained the other European nations and weakened many administrations.\n\nEcologists are also warning about the effects of losing many thousands of hectares of forest and how it may affect the already fragile ecosystems.\n\nThe heatwave and fires continue to rage on with it not expected to cease until another couple weeks."

 news_event.10.t: "The Northern Scorching"
 news_event.10.d: "In the far northern hemisphere, a catastrophic situation has been slowly developing. As global temperatures have been slowly increasing over the past several centuries, permafrost coverage in Siberia and even parts of North America have reached dangerously low levels.\n\nIncreased global temperatures has led to an increase of permafrost thawing, releasing greenhouse gases which only serve to speed up the initial, global temperature increase.\n\nNot only that, but wildfires have become more prevalent up in the north as these gases, and the exposed permafrost soil, are extremely flammable. Authorities are struggling to keep up with the increasing number of fires and citizens have often take it upon themselves to fireproof their homes and communities. How long can this continue?"
 news_event_option.10.a: "We went down, and the flames went higher"
 news_event.12.t: "Flight of the Locusts"
 news_event.12.d: "A foul blow has befallen the few remaining grain-growing regions of the world, a global plague almost biblical in nature.\n\nS. vorax, the newly discovered hybrid species of grasshopper which has been found across the Americas and much of the Old-World, has been spotted forming astronomically sized swarms. Already, swarms billions-strong have obliterated crop fields in the Ukraine, the Levant, and central North America and are continuing onto more bountiful plains.\n\nThe International Institute for Ecosystem Stability has issued a Code-black emergency and is urging farmers to perform early harvests or to torch their crop entirely to prevent an even greater catastrophe, but many are concerned about the already diminished reserves of food and the futility of starving out the swarms. Some farmers have even made makeshift flamethrowers to attack the swarms directly, but hope is in limited supply. Perhaps this is yet another nail in the coffin for civilisation. They are the Vorax, and they have come as Death's herald."

 news_event.13.t: "The Third Millennium Eurotunnel"
 news_event.13.d: "The first version of the Eurotunnel was completed in 1994, more than two centuries ago, crossing the English Channel and thus linking the former France and the old United Kingdom.\n\nIt was the longest stretch of underwater railway in the world, allowing crossing from the continent to the island in less than 40 minutes. The machinery used in its construction amounted to 1,100 tonnes, with the capacity to drill 20 kilometres without interruption. 16 billion euros from private companies financed the project.\n\nBut the progress of science and of these European powers made it possible to develop drilling techniques far more effective than any that had got before. Thanks to the progress of the Scottish mining industry, cooperating with the English government and largely with funding from France (later Franco-Iberian) a much larger capacity tunnel was completed: the Third Millennium Eurotunnel.\n\nThis tunnel has the capacity for four maglev rail tracks, two in each direction, and a four-space motorway. Millions of people travel through these tunnels every month, connecting the two countries as never before.\n\nIf you are interested in travelling from Oxford to Paris you can get a train ticket now, it won't take more than an hour.\n\nIn fact if you think deeply about it, it would take you more time packing up than actually travelling!"

 news_event.15.t: "The WCRB-Lua Colony"
 news_event.15.d: "Known as the "The Swiss Plebiscite" and taking place in the year 2107, Old Switzerland was split between Italy, France, and Germany through a combination of economic and political pressures. Despite famines and economic shortcomings, Switzerland proper remained largely unaffected by the Great Mistake, making it the envy of the crippled powers of Europe.\n\nDuring the Dark Ages, many extraterrestrial projects were abandoned due to a lack of funding, with the "Mars Tragedy" being the most well-known. The WCRB-Lua Moon Colony was founded by the Swiss as a tourist destination in 2074. Old flight plans put the colony's population at roughly 40 people. Post-Mistake rescue attempts were seen as unfeasible and, for most of the 22nd century, the colony was thought lost forever.\n\nHowever, German scientists have recently noticed subtle signs that WCRB-Lua has survived. Some parts of the scientific community have argued that the colonists must have survived in stasis, while others have dismissed the notion as mere conjecture.\n\nFortunately, due to high popular support for the expedition, and to test humanity's spaceborne capacities, the German Federation has authorized the Roter-Mond Mission. Scheduled to be carried out next month, international treaties have already been signed to avoid complications and INTEGR sympathizers worldwide have convened to express their support. The Swiss region itself, an autonomous part of Germany, is planning a nation-wide celebration. Thousands are expected to attend and watch the operation unfold."

 news_event.16.t: "End Of An Age"
 news_event.16.d: "Many historians around the globe have named specific periods of modern history after the superpower that characterized them. The 19th and early 20th centuries were the "British Century"; the decades between the Second World War and the Great Mistake were the "American Century"; and the last hundred years have been collectively referred to as the "Chinese Century". Despite the breakdown of global interactions, the People's Republic of China had expanded its influence across much of Asia while its biggest competitors fractured. Even today, China controls some of the world's most productive and densely populated regions. On multiple occasions, statisticians have deduced that no continent, with the possible exception of Africa, is competitive with China on an economic and military level.\n\nHowever, as the old saying would have it, a China long united must divide. Whether the product of destiny or human error, China has been gradually receding from international politics. Non-intervention in Siberia, the informal exit of the Central Asian Federation from its sphere of influence, and a dramatic decrease in annual scientific breakthroughs has been enough to convince many political theorists of China's decline. It can be said that the following century, if there will be one left once the decade is through, will belong not to the People's Republic of China or a sole region, but rather to a multipolar world. Although China divulges little information about its interior politics, satellites have reported mass troops movement within the country. Some argue that the country is headed straight for a civil war, while others believe that this is the beginning of a massive Chinese expansion across the Eurasian landmass. Whatever the case, it is now nigh undeniable that China is no longer the same power that it was almost a century ago."

 franco_event.1.t: "Franco-Iberia, a dream come true"
 franco_event.1.d: "Following the disolussion of the European Union in the mid 21st century, the French and Iberian nations found common aims. Initially an alliance of necessity, the Franco-Iberian Federation developed to become a country in its own right.\n\nConsidering itself to be the last bastion of true democracy and the defender of Western Civilization, the Federation seeks to expand its reach across the globe. In Europe, the Federation prides itself as the dominant power, both economically and militarily."
 franco_event_option.1.a: "Like a phoenix, we have returned!"
 franco_event.2.t: "A Cultural Boom!"
 franco_event.2.d: "What else needs to be said about Franco-Iberia? Probably the most stable country on Earth, one of the most prosperous economies, the shining beacon of democratic values and now, a heartland for cultural innovation.\n\nRecently, new city-planning techniques, building design and institutions have propped up and fantastical forms of art and entertainment are providing newfound hope and happiness for the masses. At the forefront of this cultural renaissance, are people like Marcial Azahar and Victorino Hadrien, two giants of architecture and city planning who are working closely with city officials, and even space colonization experts, to bring the future to the present.\n\nIn Entertainment and Art, new videogames, films, and interactive entertainment are equally transforming Franco-Iberian culture. One example is director Myriam Marthe, a star in the European film industry, whose revolutionary film style has created an entirely new genre: Marthe-ism.\n\nThrough these brilliant minds and many more, we can surely expect Franco-Iberia to push to the infinite."

 franco_event.3.t: "Andalusian Solar Thermal Plant"
 franco_event.3.d: "Construction has begun in Franco-Iberia, in the region of Andalusia, of a massive 6th gen Solar Thermal Plant. The plant has been a massive economic endeavour with construction expected to be complete in about a year. Andalusia is also one of the sunniest and warmest regions of not just Iberia but all of Europe, and so energy output is expected to be tremendous.\n\nUnlike the common solar panel, the plant uses mirrors to reflect sunlight and boil a central steam generator, making the components required significantly cheaper. Already, multiple thousands of reflective panels are being brought in and, according to the architects, the central tower will be over 200 metres tall, a massive monument to Franco-Iberian ambition."

 franco_event.4.t: "The APOLLO Project"
 franco_event.4.d: "The holy grail of physics, the elusive culmination of human mastery, a working nuclear fusion reactor, has just been engineered. Long thought out-of-reach by much of the scientific community or even physically impossible by many critics, a crude but functional prototype named "Apollo" has stunned much of the world.\n\nThis brilliant construct built by Dr. John Atkins and his team has now drawn mass attention from the entire scientific community. By inputting lightweight hydrogen isotopes into an electromagnetically stable chamber and giving it a quick jolt of energy, Atkins has been able to create a reliable and long-lasting source of electricity that may be the key to interstellar travel and humanity's future energy problems.\n\nNow, with his paper on the device just now being published, it's expected that government agencies and institutions around the world may soon begin construction of their own fusion reactors."

 german_event.1.t: "The INTEGR Initiative"
 german_event.1.d: "Since its foundation, the initiative has faced a lot of enemies. Its biggest one, Franco-Iberia, has opposed for so long the ideals of the INTEGR with a classist and elitist agenda. Now, led by Ebner, the movement in Germany has expanded as never seen before.\n\nCombining humanist and progressives views, she came up with a new concept: transmodernism. Not just any transmodernism but one from the mind and spirit. With the aim of looking after the environment and Earth, as well as taking care of every single citizen regardless where they come from, the party has boomed in popularity and gained the power years ago, keeping its high support since then.\n\nThe ambitious leader, Lena Ebner, has publicly declared her animosity against Franco-Iberia and her cousin, Élodie, reducing diplomatic actions between both nations and all those who followed the mistaken path of "those old fashioned imperialists"."
 german_event_option.1.a: "Long live the INTEGR!"
 german_event.11.t: "61/1999"
 german_event.11.d: "Lena Ebner held a speech in the Bundestag today:\n"Germany welcomed millions of refugees when the oceans started swallowing up metropolises. We accepted millions more when other governments drowned under the pressures of the Great Mistake. We have never forgotten the mistakes of the 20th century, and accepted our responsibility to be better. It has never been easy. And there's still more coming, every day, seeking the beacon of justice and righteousness that we have erected.\n\nMost of those refugees are part of our society now, and we are proud of them. Thanks in no small part to them, we are now in a better position than ever to tackle the problems of the future. The Dark Days are over! And that means looking forward, as we've always done, as I've promised to continue doing, looking at ways we can serve our citizens - and the world!\n\nAnd that requires us to confront those whom we have failed. Because despite everything we've done so far, not every refugee is happy.  Not all of them housed, fed, safe. You've all seen the images of the container cities slowly succumbing to mud and squalor. This must be unacceptable to us. It certainly is to me.\nAnd naturally these people we've let down are starting to look to other saviours - the North Sea Alliance chiefly amongst them. And the NSA has great plans. But do those plans really have their best interest at heart, or are they monuments to human hybris? It is understandable that these plans fascinate some people, Especially those nostalgic for their old coastal nations. But they are not the way forward.\nWe should take this as a warning sign that we need to be careful not to become complacent in our efforts.\n\nAnd every person that falls through the cracks is a person whose potential we are wasting. It will take all of us to fix the mistakes of our ancestors, the mistakes we, as humanity, are still making every day. Every scientist, engineer, nurse and teacher counts. We cannot afford to squander their lives.\n\nTherefore, I am asking you to approve ordinance 61/1999. It covers streamlining the asylum process, improving refugee access to welfare payments, expanding virtual classrooms, and more money for safety and health inspection in the settlements. It also allows for more in-depth data collection systems to measure the impact of these policies qualitatively.\nI'm also calling for us to appreciate the outstanding work that the local volunteer's corps are doing. Not only are they at the forefront of providing stable housing to the needy, they have also provided invaluable know-how during our fact-finding. I think their efforts deserve more recognition, and 61/1999 will also lower bureaucratic hurdles and streamline the funding process for them.\n\nLet us show them what INTEGR can do for them!""

 german_event.12.t: "An Unexpected Visitor"
 german_event.12.d: ""Hey you, are you lost?"\nThe woman bending down over Ruben's small statue has piercingly pale eyes, but they aren't cold as you'd expect, they are anything but that. His own face, in contrast, is muddy from playing in the streets, which really don't deserve that name. The only exception are two clear streaks where his tears have washed it. The boy stares at her in fascination, completely forgetting to actually answer the question. She smiles beatifically, holding out a hand. "Come on, I'll walk you home. Where do you live?" The boy hesitates for only a second before taking her hand. "C-Container 30, row Z4. Er, C4," he corrects himself. "It's hard to remember, I get them mixed up a lot. That's why I don't know where to go... There's no signs." He's about to burst into tears again. The woman squeezes his hand. "Don't worry, we'll get you home."\n\nA short while later they arrive, knocking at the container house's door - or rather the sheet metal that's taking the place where a door should be. Ruben's mother opens it and her face lights up as she sees her son returned home safe. "There you are, you little rascal!" she says, with a heavy dutch accent. Only then does she realise she doesn't know who it is that brought her wayward son home. Her eyes wander to the INTEGR pin on the guest's jacket. Then they wander to the posters providing splotches of colour to the rust walls of the shipping container: Duncan Hughes' stark profile, glorious shots of ARKs, in short - North Sea Alliance propaganda. And the woman's relief at having her son returned turns into dread. The woman smiles at her, trying to put her at ease. "Don't worry, please. You have nothing to fear. This is serendipitous, actually. I'm here to talk about..." she nods towards one of the posters. "That, actually. Wanted to see it with my own eyes. I just need to understand. The NSA aren't our friends. They aren't yours, either. So why? Why do my people keep telling me there are more and more of you supporting their ideas?"\n\nRuben's mother sighs. "Take a look around you. What is there for us here? Worse yet, what's there for him?" She ruffles her son's hair.\nEva nods thoughtfully. She's seen the 'No Future' graffitoed across the settlement's walls. "It's cruel. Like a plant denied space to grow up. I promise you, I'll do my best to fix this. I have an idea for how to start already."\nShe bends down so that she is level with Ruben's. "Something for you." She gingerly places a collection of earthen balls into his hand. He smells the clay, and asks: "What's that?"\n"The future in ten grams: Seed balls! They've got everything a plant needs to thrive. Plant this, take care of it, and one seed becomes ten, a hundred, a forest. Remember where we met? If you planted a few of these there, the playground won't be so full of mud after every rain, and you won't get lost anymore if there's trees to show the way. Share a few of them with your friends, too. Making more is easy, we'll teach you. And then you can teach them. And they can teach theirs, and together you'll create an oasis here that people will want to live in."\n\nRuben carefully puts the balls into his pocket. "I don't get it, who are you? Who just walks around with seed balls in their pockets?"\n"I'm Eva Rosenfeld. And I want to create a better future. Will you help me?""

 scotland_event.1.d: "The Alliance was founded by Scotland with the aim of fighting the rising tide hand in hand between its members. While England was occupied by its own internal instability, Scotland developed, in a joint research with Ireland, Norway, Greenland and Iceland, cutting-edge technology in pumping and drainage.\n\nLater, the NSA accepted a recovered England as a new member, which started to compete against Scotland for leadership. Since then the Alliance skyrocketed economicaly, becoming comparable to many other powers in the international stage.\n\nNow, England is facing internal instability, but this time the surrounding powers are ready to interve.

The judicial system is overwhelmed, the prisons are at capacity, the police cannot cope with all the violent gatherings.\n\nThe media feed the situation with dramatic images, viral videos of police beating demonstrators.

 news_event.14.t: "Dragons"
 news_event.14.d: "Winter was difficult in old Pennsylvania. Apart from the ever-present threat of bandit attacks, villages had to make do with limited harvests. The lack of modern harvesters, combined with gang warfare and regular livestock raids, meant that no agriculture was possible beyond the sustenance level. As villagers were forced to spend most of the year farming, superstitions and legends returned to the popular imagination. Common practices included the planting of seeds under specific stars, the making of totems to ward off raiders and evil spirits, and preset seating arrangements.\n\nDifferent villages had different beliefs, but a common trait found in all was an intense fear of the unknown. Villagers often avoided untrodden trails, lest they lead to a faceless monster in the woods, or a mind horror along the abandoned shores.\n\nIn one village (which happened to be situated near a small mountain), the inhabitants were convinced that a dragon lived in the nearby cave. When ARC engineers arrived to repair a barn, they were told tales of a fire-breathing monster stealing cattle and young women during the dead of night. The local militia, armed with pitchforks and pre-war hunting rifles, once organized a hunt to find and slay the beast. Few returned, but those who did retold a haunting scene: the dragon had scales made of steel, it incinerated people with its breath, and had giant red eyes. Since the incident, the locals have voted to abandon their settlement and move in with their neighbors a few miles over."
