  news_event.11.t: "Welcome to the 23rd Century!"
  news_event.11.d: "3! 2! 1! Happy New Year! The clocks across the planet rang out in momentous joy as the streets were filled with the emotional jubilation of a brand-new century. Champagne corks popped in unison and celebration roared across the entire human race. Everyone from the lowly grain-farmer to the multimillionaire executive was now cheering an event that comes once in almost every lifetime. \n\nBeginning in the Pacific, midnight swept westwards, endowing delight but also relief in billions across the world. This was an awfully special centennial for most. The previous century had brought nothing but pain and death. In an almost biblical myth, the world was ravaged by conquests, warfare, famine, and general death. The seas had risen so high that entire cities were swallowed. Traditional governments had been slashed apart by the needs of the masses. Diseases, new and old, had poisoned so many, eliminated entire nations. The number dead... a soul-crushing statistic. Now, these people could finally let go of some of their pent-up grief.\n\nTears, not smiles, were the most common sight on New Year's Day. Humanity had suffered and the planet had suffered with them. But, finally, after so long, things were beginning to look up. Space exploration has become a glorious and achievable prospect. Human ingenuity has eased much of the unnecessary pain that plagued so many. And, although she has many scars, mother nature seems to be in a relatively stable condition.\n\nThe future is bright as long as we continue to reach for those bright, hopeful stars.\n\n§CWelcome to the 23rd Century, gentlemen.§!"

  news_event.12.t: "The State of the Church"
  news_event.12.d: "The Catholic Church was once the largest religious group in the world throughout the past several centuries. It has had a history of splits, rivalries and rebellions, including the Great Schism, which led to the creation of the Orthodox Churches, and the Protestant Reformation, which established several new reformed churches such as Lutherans, Calvinists, and Presbyterians, to name a few. Despite the events of the past, the Catholic Church still stood strong in the world, triumphing over almost every obstacle it faced. But once again, the history repeats itself. Catholicism splits once more.\n\nThe "Old" Papacy, located in South America, claims to be the true spearhead of what the Church was always supposed to mean: humanity and solidarity, while keeping Catholic teachings alive and a decentralized power structure.\n\nThe "New" Papacy, located in the reborn, historical city of Avignon, has always made the effort of overcoming change while keeping its conservative values and centralized power structure. It has come under scrutiny and criticism for being the most stagnant branch of the Church in an effort to keep the traditional idea of the Church alive, favouring the ruling elite and accepting the patronage and assistance of leaders favourable to this entity, while also criticising the Old Papacy for not being true Catholics.\n\nThis has been known as the “Second Great Schism”."

  news_event.13.t: "The Third Millennium Eurotunnel"
  news_event.13.d: "The first version of the Eurotunnel was completed in 1994, more than two centuries ago, crossing the English Channel and thus linking the former France and the old United Kingdom.\n\nIt was the longest stretch of underwater railway in the world, allowing crossing from the continent to the island in less than 40 minutes. The machinery used in its construction amounted to 1,100 tonnes, with the capacity to drill 20 kilometres without interruption. 16 billion euros from private companies financed the project.\n\nBut the progress of science and of these European powers made it possible to develop drilling techniques far more effective than any that had got before. Thanks to the progress of the Scottish mining industry, cooperating with the English government and largely with funding from France (later Franco-Iberian) a much larger capacity tunnel was completed: the Third Millennium Eurotunnel.\n\nThis tunnel has the capacity for four maglev rail tracks, two in each direction, and a four-space motorway. Millions of people travel through these tunnels every month, connecting the two countries as never before.\n\nIf you are interested in travelling from Oxford to Paris you can get a train ticket now, it won't take more than an hour.\n\nIn fact if you think deeply about it, it would take you more time packing up than actually travelling!"

  news_event.15.t: "The WCRB-Lua Colony"
  news_event.15.d: "Known as the "The Swiss Plebiscite" and taking place in the year 2107, Old Switzerland was split between Italy, France, and Germany through a combination of economic and political pressures. Despite famines and economic shortcomings, Switzerland proper remained largely unaffected by the Great Mistake, making it the envy of the crippled powers of Europe.\n\nDuring the Dark Ages, many extraterrestrial projects were abandoned due to a lack of funding, with the "Mars Tragedy" being the most well-known. The WCRB-Lua Moon Colony was founded by the Swiss as a tourist destination in 2074. Old flight plans put the colony's population at roughly 40 people. Post-Mistake rescue attempts were seen as unfeasible and, for most of the 22nd century, the colony was thought lost forever.\n\nHowever, German scientists have recently noticed subtle signs that WCRB-Lua has survived. Some parts of the scientific community have argued that the colonists must have survived in stasis, while others have dismissed the notion as mere conjecture.\n\nFortunately, due to high popular support for the expedition, and to test humanity's spaceborne capacities, the German Federation has authorized the Roter-Mond Mission. Scheduled to be carried out next month, international treaties have already been signed to avoid complications and INTEGR sympathizers worldwide have convened to express their support. The Swiss region itself, an autonomous part of Germany, is planning a nation-wide celebration. Thousands are expected to attend and watch the operation unfold."

  news_event.16.t: "End of an Age"
  news_event.16.d: "Many historians around the globe have named specific periods of modern history after the superpower that characterized them. The 19th and early 20th centuries were the "British Century"; the decades between the Second World War and the Great Mistake were the "American Century"; and the last hundred years have been collectively referred to as the "Chinese Century". Despite the breakdown of global interactions, the People's Republic of China had expanded its influence across much of Asia while its biggest competitors fractured. Even today, China controls some of the world's most productive and densely populated regions. On multiple occasions, statisticians have deduced that no continent, with the possible exception of Africa, is competitive with China on an economic and military level.\n\nHowever, as the old saying would have it, a China long united must divide. Whether the product of destiny or human error, China has been gradually receding from international politics. Non-intervention in Siberia, the informal exit of the Central Asian Federation from its sphere of influence, and a dramatic decrease in annual scientific breakthroughs has been enough to convince many political theorists of China's decline. It can be said that the following century, if there will be one left once the decade is through, will belong not to the People's Republic of China or a sole region, but rather to a multipolar world. Although China divulges little information about its interior politics, satellites have reported mass troops movement within the country. Some argue that the country is headed straight for a civil war, while others believe that this is the beginning of a massive Chinese expansion across the Eurasian landmass. Whatever the case, it is now nigh undeniable that China is no longer the same power that it was almost a century ago."

#Dragons Event #ONLY FOR DISTRICT 3!

 news_event.14.t: "Dragons"
 news_event.14.d: "Winter was difficult in old Pennsylvania. Apart from the ever-present threat of bandit attacks, villages had to make do with limited harvests. The lack of modern harvesters, combined with gang warfare and regular livestock raids, meant that no agriculture was possible beyond the sustenance level. As villagers were forced to spend most of the year farming, superstitions and legends returned to the popular imagination. Common practices included the planting of seeds under specific stars, the making of totems to ward off raiders and evil spirits, and preset seating arrangements.\n\nDifferent villages had different beliefs, but a common trait found in all was an intense fear of the unknown. Villagers often avoided untrodden trails, lest they lead to a faceless monster in the woods, or a mind horror along the abandoned shores.\n\nIn one village (which happened to be situated near a small mountain), the inhabitants were convinced that a dragon lived in the nearby cave. When ARC engineers arrived to repair a barn, they were told tales of a fire-breathing monster stealing cattle and young women during the dead of night. The local militia, armed with pitchforks and pre-war hunting rifles, once organized a hunt to find and slay the beast. Few returned, but those who did retold a haunting scene: the dragon had scales made of steel, it incinerated people with its breath, and had giant red eyes. Since the incident, the locals have voted to abandon their settlement and move in with their neighbors a few miles over."
