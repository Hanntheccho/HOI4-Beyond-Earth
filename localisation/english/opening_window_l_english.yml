 welcome_to_be_desc_event:0 "The clocks across the planet rang out in momentous joy as the streets were filled with the emotional jubilation of a brand-new century. Champagne corks popped in unison and celebration roared across the entire human race. Everyone from the lowly grain-farmer to the multimillionaire executive was now cheering an event that comes once in almost every lifetime. \n\nBeginning in the Pacific, midnight swept westwards, endowing delight but also relief in billions across the world. This was an awfully special centennial for most. The previous century had brought nothing but pain and death. In an almost biblical myth, the world was ravaged by conquests, warfare, famine, and general death. The seas had risen so high that entire cities were swallowed. Traditional governments had been slashed apart by the needs of the masses. Diseases, new and old, had poisoned so many, eliminated entire nations. The number dead... a soul-crushing statistic. Now, these people could finally let go of some of their pent-up grief.\n\nTears, not smiles, were the most common sight on New Year's Day. Humanity had suffered and the planet had suffered with them. But, finally, after so long, things were beginning to look up. Space exploration has become a glorious and achievable prospect. Human ingenuity has eased much of the unnecessary pain that plagued so many. And, although she has many scars, mother nature seems to be in a relatively stable condition.\n\nThe future is bright as long as we continue to reach for those bright, hopeful stars.\n\nWelcome to the 23rd Century, gentlemen."
