  norway_event.1.t: "The Swedish Question"
  norway_event.1.d: "Norway has been a part of the North Sea Alliance for quite some time, and we share its goal of recovering Europe from the Great Mistake. But, of course, our habitable land is sparse, and we can't hold all of the population in it for the observable future, especially considering the ever-rising sea level. We have a solution for it - ARKs. Mobile sea platforms hosting entire cities, invincible to any and all whims of nature, but we don't have enough space and resources for any realistic ARK construction in Norway. On the other hand, Sweden possesses an amazing strategic location, a wide shoreline and plenty of metals and minerals to fuel our plans. Of course, we can't just invade them with 'give us your stuff' as an official reason, that would get us removed from the NSA at best or removed from Europe at worst. To avert this, we have begun digging up every single bit of dirt we have on Sweden, from weapons smuggling and terrorism to being inhospitable neighbors to justify our invasion. But of course, we must be careful to not antagonise or alienate people of Sweden. Only their government."
