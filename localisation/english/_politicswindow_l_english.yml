#HELP BUTTONS
 
 help_current_bills:0 "This top half of the screen is used for §Cpassing bills and new laws§!. Click on one of the §C4 categories§! to open the §C6 bills§! within that you can pass. Hover over a bill to see its effects and which parties support it.\n\n§BPolitical Bills§! allow you to increase or decrease trade and conscription laws, but also allow you to justify war goals and send volunteer forces.\n\n§YEconomy Bills§! give you greater control over the economy. They can help you develop faster, unlock sliders, and are very helpful when relying on the free market.\n\n§GMilitary Bills§! can help you recruit more generals, expand the armed forces, train units faster or conduct research at greater speeds.\n\n§RProposition Bills§! are prerequisites for certain foci and decisions in your nation. These range from easy to pass popular bills, to the controversial divisive bills.\n\nWhen you select a bill, the Parliament will have a §Chearing on it§!. Your §CParliament Power§! must meet or exceed a certain §Cpercentage§!, based on your political system and other factors, for the bill to pass. You have §C30 days to meet the required support§! or the bill will fail. If a bill fails, you can still try to propose it again at a later date. There is a §C60 day cooldown§! between every proposition.\n\nYour starting Parliament Power for each new bill proposed is equal to your party popularity at that time, plus the party popularity of any parties that support the bill in question. Changes to your party popularity during the hearing will have no effect on the bill."
