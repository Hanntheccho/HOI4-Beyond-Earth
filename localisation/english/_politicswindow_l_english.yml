Hover over a bill to see its effects and which parties support it.\n\n§BPolitical Bills§! allow you to increase or decrease trade and conscription laws, but also allow you to justify war goals and send volunteer forces.\n\n§YEconomy Bills§! give you greater control over the economy. They can help you develop faster, unlock sliders, and are very helpful when relying on the free market.\n\n§GMilitary Bills§! can help you recruit more generals, expand the armed forces, train units faster or conduct research at greater speeds.\n\n§RProposition Bills§! are prerequisites for certain foci and decisions in your nation. These range from easy to pass popular bills, to the controversial divisive bills.\n\nWhen you select a bill, the Parliament will have a §Chearing on it§!. Your §CParliament Power§! must meet or exceed a certain §Cpercentage§!, based on your political system and other factors, for the bill to pass. You have §C30 days to meet the required support§! or the bill will fail. If a bill fails, you can still try to propose it again at a later date. There is a §C60 day cooldown§! between every proposition.\n\nYour starting Parliament Power for each new bill proposed is equal to your party popularity at that time, plus the party popularity of any parties that support the bill in question. Changes to your party popularity during the hearing will have no effect on the bill."
 help_free_factory:0 "An alternative to state planned construction is the §Cfree market§!. All economic systems allow the market to grant your country §CFree Factories§!. The speed at which you gain factories is determined by your country's §CDevelopment Level and Economy Law§!, and then adjusted by national spirits, decisions, leaders, etc. Every day, the bar will progress by a number determined by the factors listed above.\n\nOnce that number reaches §C100%§!, your country will gain a §Crandom Free Factory anywhere§!.The drawback is that you are unable to choose which specific factory you will gain and where it will be placed."
 help_corruption_help:0 "All states are prone to corruption. §CEvery day§!, your country will gain a certain amount of corruption, §Cdetermined by your political system§! (societies that prize plurality and transparency are less prone to corruption than their authoritarian counterparts, national spirits, etc.)\n\nEvery increment of 10 (i.e. 10, 20, 30) will increase the corruption penalty. While lower corruption increments are negligible, §Chigher levels of corruption can cripple your nation§!.\n\nAdditionally, once corruption reaches an increment, it §Rcannot be decreased below that increment§! (i.e. if corruption is at 23% and you decrease it by 5%, it will only go down to 20%). Therefore, one must always §Ckeep track of corruption§! and purge it before it can be allowed to spread."
