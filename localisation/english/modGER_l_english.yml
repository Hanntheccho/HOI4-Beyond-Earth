 GER_lena_ebner:0 "Lena Ebner"
 GER_lena_ebner_desc:0 "\n\n\n£lena_ebner_text\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Berlin to a German diplomat and a Polish teacher, Lena was raised as a "child of the world". Over the course of 15 years, she lived on four continents and learned to speak eight languages.\n\nLena fought fearlessly for refugee rights throughout central and eastern Europe. Her early work at the Braungart-Wissel Foundation for Environmental Law garnered her acclaim, and she was soon seen as an emerging leader of sustainability and the environmental policymaking. As she became a prominent lawyer-activist in post-Mistake Europe, Lena was an increasingly easy target for Franco-Iberian politicians. Painted as a desperate anarchist, Lena's non-traditional lifestyle and worldview was frequently highlighted in order to polarize moderates. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR.\n\nIt wasn't until Lena's most vocal and harshest critic (and cousin), Élodie, began her campaign for Franco-Iberian politics that Lena's vision for a transmodernist society crystallized. Transmodernism meant xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."

Much remains to be done, but many hope that its leaders will be up to the task.\n\nIntegration and legal parity between countries is the way to harmony in Europe... and eventually, the planet at large.\n\n§LOn the edge of the abyss, Europe once again manages to emerge from a dark period.

 #Events
  #german_event.1.t: "The INTEGR Initiative"
  #german_event.1.d: "Since its foundation, the initiative has faced a lot of enemies. Its biggest one, Franco-Iberia, has opposed for so long the ideals of the INTEGR with a classist and elitist agenda. Now, led by Ebner, the movement in Germany has expanded as never seen before.\n\nCombining humanist and progressives views, she came up with a new concept: transmodernism. Not just any transmodernism but one from the mind and spirit. With the aim of looking after the environment and Earth, as well as taking care of every single citizen regardless where they come from, the party has boomed in popularity and gained the power years ago, keeping its high support since then.\n\nThe ambitious leader, Lena Ebner, has publicly declared her animosity against Franco-Iberia and her cousin, Élodie, reducing diplomatic actions between both nations and all those who followed the mistaken path of "those old fashioned imperialists"."
  #german_event_option.1.a: "Long live the INTEGR!"
  #german_event.11.t: "61/1999"
  #german_event.11.d: "Lena Ebner held a speech in the Bundestag today:\n"Germany welcomed millions of refugees when the oceans started swallowing up metropolises. We accepted millions more when other governments drowned under the pressures of the Great Mistake. We have never forgotten the mistakes of the 20th century, and accepted our responsibility to be better. It has never been easy. And there's still more coming, every day, seeking the beacon of justice and righteousness that we have erected.\n\nMost of those refugees are part of our society now, and we are proud of them. Thanks in no small part to them, we are now in a better position than ever to tackle the problems of the future. The Dark Days are over! And that means looking forward, as we've always done, as I've promised to continue doing, looking at ways we can serve our citizens - and the world!\n\nAnd that requires us to confront those whom we have failed. Because despite everything we've done so far, not every refugee is happy.  Not all of them housed, fed, safe. You've all seen the images of the container cities slowly succumbing to mud and squalor. This must be unacceptable to us. It certainly is to me.\nAnd naturally these people we've let down are starting to look to other saviours - the North Sea Alliance chiefly amongst them. And the NSA has great plans. But do those plans really have their best interest at heart, or are they monuments to human hybris? It is understandable that these plans fascinate some people, Especially those nostalgic for their old coastal nations. But they are not the way forward.\nWe should take this as a warning sign that we need to be careful not to become complacent in our efforts.\n\nAnd every person that falls through the cracks is a person whose potential we are wasting. It will take all of us to fix the mistakes of our ancestors, the mistakes we, as humanity, are still making every day. Every scientist, engineer, nurse and teacher counts. We cannot afford to squander their lives.\n\nTherefore, I am asking you to approve ordinance 61/1999. It covers streamlining the asylum process, improving refugee access to welfare payments, expanding virtual classrooms, and more money for safety and health inspection in the settlements. It also allows for more in-depth data collection systems to measure the impact of these policies qualitatively.\nI'm also calling for us to appreciate the outstanding work that the local volunteer's corps are doing. Not only are they at the forefront of providing stable housing to the needy, they have also provided invaluable know-how during our fact-finding. I think their efforts deserve more recognition, and 61/1999 will also lower bureaucratic hurdles and streamline the funding process for them.\n\nLet us show them what INTEGR can do for them!""
  #german_event_option.11.a: "Ordinance 61/1999 was approved unanimously."
  #german_event.12.t: "An Unexpected Visitor"
  #german_event.12.d: ""Hey you, are you lost?"\nThe woman bending down over Ruben's small statue has piercingly pale eyes, but they aren't cold as you'd expect, they are anything but that. His own face, in contrast, is muddy from playing in the streets, which really don't deserve that name. The only exception are two clear streaks where his tears have washed it. The boy stares at her in fascination, completely forgetting to actually answer the question. She smiles beatifically, holding out a hand. "Come on, I'll walk you home. Where do you live?" The boy hesitates for only a second before taking her hand. "C-Container 30, row Z4. Er, C4," he corrects himself. "It's hard to remember, I get them mixed up a lot. That's why I don't know where to go... There's no signs." He's about to burst into tears again. The woman squeezes his hand. "Don't worry, we'll get you home."\n\nA short while later they arrive, knocking at the container house's door - or rather the sheet metal that's taking the place where a door should be. Ruben's mother opens it and her face lights up as she sees her son returned home safe. "There you are, you little rascal!" she says, with a heavy dutch accent. Only then does she realise she doesn't know who it is that brought her wayward son home. Her eyes wander to the INTEGR pin on the guest's jacket. Then they wander to the posters providing splotches of colour to the rust walls of the shipping container: Duncan Hughes' stark profile, glorious shots of ARKs, in short - North Sea Alliance propaganda. And the woman's relief at having her son returned turns into dread. The woman smiles at her, trying to put her at ease. "Don't worry, please. You have nothing to fear. This is serendipitous, actually. I'm here to talk about..." she nods towards one of the posters. "That, actually. Wanted to see it with my own eyes. I just need to understand. The NSA aren't our friends. They aren't yours, either. So why? Why do my people keep telling me there are more and more of you supporting their ideas?"\n\nRuben's mother sighs. "Take a look around you. What is there for us here? Worse yet, what's there for him?" She ruffles her son's hair.\nEva nods thoughtfully. She's seen the 'No Future' graffitoed across the settlement's walls. "It's cruel. Like a plant denied space to grow up. I promise you, I'll do my best to fix this. I have an idea for how to start already."\nShe bends down so that she is level with Ruben's. "Something for you." She gingerly places a collection of earthen balls into his hand. He smells the clay, and asks: "What's that?"\n"The future in ten grams: Seed balls! They've got everything a plant needs to thrive. Plant this, take care of it, and one seed becomes ten, a hundred, a forest. Remember where we met? If you planted a few of these there, the playground won't be so full of mud after every rain, and you won't get lost anymore if there's trees to show the way. Share a few of them with your friends, too. Making more is easy, we'll teach you. And then you can teach them. And they can teach theirs, and together you'll create an oasis here that people will want to live in."\n\nRuben carefully puts the balls into his pocket. "I don't get it, who are you? Who just walks around with seed balls in their pockets?"\n"I'm Eva Rosenfeld. And I want to create a better future. Will you help me?""

 GER_anti_franco_iberian_desc:0 "Lena Ebner represents a watershed moment in the history of post-Mistake Europe. An event of this magnitude occurs only once a generation.

A strong posture against Franco-Iberian agenda."
 GER_transhumanism_desc:0 "The "aristocratic spirit of seriousness" and "Ancien Regime of Western rationalistic technocracy" have motivated the politics of this age, with the agents of the state and entertainment serving as gatekeepers for what is "good" and what is "bad" for the people.

In both countries the Initiative has great social support and is seen as the future of the region and of Europe as a whole.\n\nThe reality is that this treaty has led to an interdependence between the signatory countries, where if the economy of one were to fall, the economy of the other would be seriously affected. That is why the engagement between these countries will be long-lasting and prosperous, as long as the ambitions of European leaders do not get in the way."
