#IDEAS
 ARG_alienated_montoneros:0 "Alienated Montoneros"
 ARG_alienated_montoneros_desc:0 "While our government is currently acknowledged as the legitimate ruling body in urban areas, villages and remote settlements do not share this sentiment. The Montoneros, a leftist paramilitary organization that is part of the Grand Coalition, openly resist our policies, even going as far as to disobey direct orders from our military. Their main support base is in the countryside, made up from the impoverished and malnourished, and they resent our focus on the urban core. If we ever wish to restore order to our territories, the Montoneros must be reined in."
 ARG_alienated_federales:0 "Alienated Federales"
 ARG_alienated_federales_desc:0 "When the great walls of Buenos Aires fell in 2132, our society changed forever. From this radical change rose the Federales, a faction composed of civil governments, bureaucrats, and civil & federal policemen. These individuals and institutions resent the Grand Coalition's focus on the capital region of Nuevos Aires. They refuse to cooperate with our plans to unify the region while also resisting urbanization of their areas. In order to cement our ideology and unify the country as a whole, they must be brought around to our point of view."
 ARG_embraced_urbanites:0 "Embraced Urbanites"
 ARG_embraced_urbanites_desc:0 "Following Nuevos Aires's establishment as the new capital of our nation, it became evident that the government is pushed by other forces. The urbanites group, made up of capitalists and entrepreneurs along with intellectuals seized the day, pushing artisans and the poor away from the spotlight of the regime, while promoting their web of businesses and amassing wealth behind the scenes. Now these powerful individuals have become the foundation of the coalition. The annual budget is padded by  their donations and our research institutions receive investments each day while the economy booms. Should the government maintain its path, these benefits will increase, along with the power of these wealthy businesspeople."
 ARG_embraced_argentinists:0 "Embraced Argentinists"
 ARG_embraced_argentinists_desc:0 "At the time anarchy swept the provinces, many forgot the idea of Argentina. All except the Argentinists, a militaristic faction that glorifies conquest and reunification at all cost. This faction, in a sharp contrast to the Federales and Oriental League, still believe that the idea of Argentina is worth fighting for. The Grand Coalition has integrated this faction to be the tip of the spear. Each passing day the Argentinists grow stronger due to the efforts of the regime in encouraging the memories of old that inspire many to reforge what was lost. Nevertheless, these patriotic warriors will either die for their beliefs or become living legends in the conflict yet to come."

#LEADER
 ARG_grand_council:0 "The Grand Council"
 ARG_grand_council_desc:0 "Argentina isn't run merely by one person. It is instead led by the Grand Council, where our four factions meet: the Federales, who want more autonomy in local regions, and thus a federalized government; the Montoneros, a guerrilla group in the more rural regions of the country advocating for agrarian socialism; the Argentinists, who are made up of radical members of the military, wishing for a centralized nationalist state; and finally, the Urbanites, who want Nuevos Aires to be the shining beacon of Argentina, dominated by the rich elite. These factions, despite having different ideological views, must coexist for the better. The future of Argentina will be decided by the machinations taking place in these halls."

#DECISIONS
  ARG_special_arrangements:0 "Special Arrangements"
  ARG_special_arrangements_desc:0 "Though the urban regions of our nation are under our control, we still do not have the power to control the more rural regions of our nation's government. Instead of projecting power, we must focus on collaborating with these local administrators by signing off deals with their industrial and agricultural centers, send them aid to keep them afloat, and making sure they don't have the ability to band together and take us down—they would be no better than Vasquez's heinous barbarians. We just have to keep them in check and take the right steps, not too little power, and not too much."
  
  ARG_the_wheels_of_the_state:0 "The Wheels of the State"
  ARG_the_wheels_of_the_state_desc:0 "We have finally reduced the power of the local governments. It was a costly endeavour, but a necessary step for national unity. Such disorder could have caused us to plunge into a second and potentially worse civil war, as they have control over important centers that keep the machine that is Argentina running. Alas, we must focus on severely reducing the power of the local governments for good. We must keep the Grand Council's power above all else, no matter where our citizens are, whether it's the factories or fields. The last step to order in Argentina is about to commence."
