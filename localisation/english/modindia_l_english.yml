 politics_thakur_desc:0 "Wisdom and meditation, though pillars of the soul, cannot sustain the weight of time. A revered and mystical figure, Raj Thakur's spiritual connections and ancient wisdom have brought him a loyal following in Bharat. But despite all his knowledge and experience, the inescapable claw of age is catching up to him. Long suffering from recurrent pancreatic cancer, Raj Thakur's mind has persevered despite his deteriorating body. The mere fact that he is still alive has been interpreted as a miracle by his more devoted followers. Now, however, his illness has surpassed even that which 22nd century science can cure, and his condition is terminal. India's voice of guidance has long since accepted his death, though perhaps the same cannot be said for his followers. Despite the decades of peace and meditation, the great fracture in Raj Thakur's serene mind is his dread for what might become of India after he is gone."

 politics_mandal_desc:0 "Raj Thakur, guiding voice of all India, left behind a powerful echo with his passing. Never before has a man been so beloved by his people, and never before has India wept, so. But time must go on, and a successor must be chosen – such is the cause of Radha Mandal. A proud follower of Thakur's wisdom ever since his childhood, Mandal spent his life in many positions. Beginning as a monk apprentice near Nepal in his formative years, Mandal eventually became disillusioned with a hermit's life and ventured into the cities, where he settled down and attended a university. First elected into local leadership at the age of 28, and then in provisional government positions, all the while still sternly practicing the beliefs of the then near divine Raj Thakur, Mandal befriended him after being elected mayor of New Lucknow. Mandal's position in government and his lifelong practice of Thakur's ideology allowed him to win a close election, barely stemming the potential tide of division that might otherwise have emerged following the old man's death.\n\nDespite being a devout Thakurist since his teenage years, his fellows, citizens, and even Mandal himself have doubts whether he can truly follow in the footsteps of such a great man. But for his master, friend and India's guiding hand, he is determined to unite the continent and bring about a cultural flourishing beyond anything that existed up to the Great Mistake."

 BHR_heart_of_india_desc:0 "Bharat is situated at the crossroads of most major Indian highways and lays claim to the industrial heartland of the North. Despite decades of setbacks and political scandals, the central government carries the most legitimate claim to the Indian Republic of old. Led by the aged politician and spiritual leader Raj Thakur, Bharat has barely managed to sustain a loose alliance of Indian warlords (albeit the alliance is more akin to an extensive non-aggression pact) who have long been fighting over our Old India. This temporary unity has netted Bharat an envious position as the crossroads of inter-warlord trade. Raj Thakur's extensive compound has also become home to influential individuals from all over the country and beyond, attracting foreign talent and much needed muscle."
 BHR_low_officer_clubs_influence:0 "Officer Clubs Influence: §YVery Low§!"
 BHR_low_officer_clubs_influence_desc:0 "Although Raj Thakur carries an extraordinary amount of influence within Bharat, and the loyalty of his people has never been in question, the issue of military interests has always been a pressing matter. In Thakur's early days, back when Bharat was still an unstable warzone between army elements, raiders, and tides of refugees, the then-young and inexperienced leader elected to ally himself with the 4th Republican Army of India. The alliance helped him to cement power and ward off opportunistic invaders, but also allowed a rot of spirit to set in.\n\nIt was not until 2137 that the kettle boiled over: military elements led by one Krishna Aurora tried to march on the capital and force Thakur into the position of a puppet. The visionary was only saved by the timely arrival of his elite guards, who arrested Krishna and convinced the army to stand down. The following years were spent detoothing most of the military and making high command completely subordinate to Thakur's civilian administration. The only autonomous part of the army now is the Officers' Club, where ambitious generals and aging commanders plot to usher in a return of their once powerful force."

 #events
 bharat_event.1.t:0 "Equipment Drives"
 bharat_event.1.d:0 "The remilitarization of India is somewhat of a redundant phrase - India has, for as long as anyone can remember, been a battleground between roving tribes and warlords, only accented by the occasional prosperous settlement. However, actual heavy industry, the type generally considered necessary for the creation of expensive military hardware, is hard to come by. Most warlords acquire their guns by scavenging or make them in makeshift factories, but Bharat is one of the few states capable of sustaining a healthy industry. This can be exploited by nationalizing arms producers, seizing manufactories from petty warlords scattered all over the countryside, and enacting a new propaganda campaign that aims to promote austerity and community service."
 bharat_event.1.a:0 "This will help us in future endeavors."
 bharat_event.2.t:0 "Industrial Drives"
 bharat_event.2.d:0 "Much of India's wealth has historically been directed towards immediate militarization efforts. Enterprising individuals with enough capital to invest into public works have almost always elected to instead pursue arms sales due to their lucrative returns. While this practice has helped Bharat raise a large standing army with an actual modern supply chain, it has also hampered long-term growth. We can try to rectify this situation by handing out generous grants to industrial contractors and slashing taxes on long-term capital assets. Inactive military units may also volunteer through a newly chartered ‘Office of Army Utilization' to help build roads and reinforce outdated forts within the interior. Our position at the crossroads of India can also allow us to increase tariffs on merchants belonging to hostile warlords or to seize their assets outright."
 bharat_event.2.a:0 "We will rebuild India, one step at a time."
 bharat_event.3.t:0 "Lucknow Reconstruction"
 bharat_event.3.d:0 "The city of Lucknow, former administrative capital of the Uttar Pradesh region and once one of the most populated cities in India, has felt the brunt of the Dark Ages. Originally a target for a Pakistani nuclear barrage during the Great Mistake, the city's missile defense system managed to intercept the attacks. However, shortly after the brief but deadly conflict, a rumor began to circulate that the city had been wiped out entirely, and that the nearby 1st Armored Division was annihilated by radiation but that its valuable equipment was left mostly intact. Naturally, this painted a giant target on the area for warlords, who by this point had capitalized on the deteriorating social and economic situation on the subcontinent to carve out their own petty states. The warlord Mishri Seth, famed for his legendary takeover of the Lions Brigade in 2097, led a spearhead of bandits and dissatisfied soldiers into the city. The local population was forced out when the 1st Armored Division, which had survived the war, returned and set up a formidable defense. Lucknow would experience some of the worst fighting during the Dark Ages, and it was not until Seth's death in 2144 (killed during a mutiny by his own troops over low rations) that the city's corpse was returned to the government. The general poverty of Dark Age India meant that few resources could be spared for Lucknow's reconstruction, which left the city mostly a ruin... until now. Recently, Raj Thakur's most trusted advisors have pledged much of their personal wealth towards aiding the repopulation and reconstruction of the area. Although the city is still too devastated by iron harvests to return to pre-war glory, it can serve as the site of new tractor plants and refugee resettlement centers."
 bharat_event.3.a:0 "To a better future for the city."
 bharat_event.4.t:0 "Fortress Revitalization"
 bharat_event.4.d:0 "During the Dark Ages, most cities had erected primitive defenses against roving marauders and rogue battalions. These included street palisades that funneled invaders into kill zones, automatic cannons on skyscrapers, mined countrysides, strategic reserve offices, and peoples' armories in every major district. As time went on and the situation in Bharat stabilized, however, the maintenance of these defenses became too much to bear and they were deactivated. Now, there are still many bunkers and ancient weapons left lying around. The maps pinpointing their locations have been lost to time, but with the help of artificial intelligence and new Network Nodes, we can begin to reactivate these security checkpoints and man them with militias and disabled volunteers from the fronts."
 bharat_event.4.a:0 "This will defend us against the darkness in the world."
 bharat_event.5.t:0 "Bharat Asks For Guns"
 bharat_event.5.d:0 "[BHR.GetLeader] and his supporters in Bharat have issued a formal request to our government, asking for an immediate shipment of guns, grenades, ammunition, mortars, and artillery pieces to help ward off raiders. While the motives behind this request can be questioned, what cannot is the tremendous influence of Bharat within our politics. Although declining is unlikely to have any significant repercussions for us, we can earn favor with the strongest state in post-Mistake India and showcase our devotion to the reunification ideals."

 bharat_event.14.t:0 "Raj Thakur Collapses"
 bharat_event.14.d:0 "Tragedy has been narrowly averted yesterday as the venerable Raj Thakur collapsed while in the middle of an online speech with municipal representatives. Thakur began the day as normal, spending three hours in the meditation chamber before attending regular medical treatment at the Capsule. He then retired to his study, from where he contacted the Officers' Club on important matters regarding intensifying raids by highwaymen. Officer Patel remarked that Thakur seemed a bit slower during the meeting and was visibly distracted by something off-camera. The following hour was spent at lunch, where a delegation of mountain hermits reported no obvious sign of illness on Thakur. At around four, Thakur lectured a group of economics students from the New University of Ghandi. The online technical assistant claimed that the old man was lively and in high spirits, a stark contrast to his condition just three hours later.\n\nThe day was to end with a meeting between Thakur and representatives from the municipalities and other warlords. The meeting had been planned for several days now and was supposed to conclude a groundbreaking trade treaty between Bharat and Odisha when suddenly Thakur fell over in his chair. Due to the leader's fierce belief in spiritual healing, his home lacked a resident doctor and it was not until twenty minutes had passed that an ambulance was dispatched. Thakur was found nearly dead in his study and immediately rushed to Sridhar Hospital. The government was left to Radha Mandal, who had returned from a meeting in West Bengal as soon as he had heard of the incident. The Officers' Club also dispatched a group of soldiers to supplement Thakur's own bodyguard, claiming that the sudden illness was the product of a failed assassination attempt. A brawl soon broke out between the two groups of guards, only to be interrupted by Thakur's incredibly short recovery. According to the nurse who was attending him, Thakur suddenly opened his eyes while in the middle of a coma and sat up straight. The leader is now recovering, but his brush with death serves as a grim foreshadowing of what may happen once the burden of time becomes too much for him."
 bharat_event.14.a:0 "All of India breathes a sigh of relief."
 bharat_event.15.t:0 "The Orchicha Destruction"
 bharat_event.15.d:0 "Tragedy! The nuclear plant in Orchicha has suffered a meltdown in the early hours of the morning! Reports are still scarce, but the Ministry of the Interior has called in guards and claims that the meltdown has already claimed over two thousand lives. The plant, a relic of the Golden Ages, had never completely ceased operating once in its one hundred and thirteen year long lifespan.\n\nThe high demand for energy, only further increased in the Dark Days, prevented restructuring or proper maintenance from happening. According to some scientists, the meltdown was an inevitability, a product of poor upkeep and wearing a plant down until it could no longer function properly. But for the people near Orchicha, a sparsely populated pre-Mistake city that had survived an indirect nuclear strike during the Great Mistake, the reality of situation is much more dramatic. Deaths are expected to skyrocket in the following months despite government efforts and nearby hydroelectric plants will need to be strained even further to make up for the loss of energy generation. This, combined with Raj Thakur's near death experience just two months prior, has been interpreted as an ill omen by some spiritual leaders and administrators."
 bharat_event.15.a:0 ""
 bharat_event.16.t:0 "Raj Thakur Falls Ill!"
 bharat_event.16.d:0 "The century keeps getting worse as Raj Thakur experienced another seizure two days ago. The old leader, now on minimal life support and accompanied by doctors, was attending an in-person opening ceremony for city gardens when he suddenly fainted in the middle of a speech by a Nepalese diplomat. Thakur was immediately carried over to a nearby arboreal bench, where he briefly regained consciousness and asked for somebody named Aditi before falling into a coughing fit. The doctors administered some medicine with the help of a nearby surgery bot, but in the end the help proved insufficient and arrangements were made to return to Sridhar Hospital. There, the esteemed Doctor Patel, renowned in India and beyond for work on limb replacements, suggested a transplant of the pancreas. Raj Thakur, barely able to speak, protested. It is a well known fact that the old leader has a distrust of modern technology and fears augmentation for corrupting the inner spirit. The hospital staff had to perform an old-school operation, and were nearly interrupted by a squad of Officer Club troops bursting into the hospital and demanding to see Thakur. Their rude intrusion was then followed by the arrival of Kavitha Thakur, Raj Thakur's daughter and current overseer of the Kavithan Protectorate to the Northwest. The two newcomers soon entered into a heated argument over Bharat's succession in the case of the old leader's death. The commotion was finally availed when Thakur recovered and summoned Mandal and Kavitha to his room. The ensuing conversation has been kept off-record, but the officers and officials believe that it concerned the issue of succession. Being Raj Thakur's daughter, Kavitha has also earned herself a reputation for being a dependable and just ruler during her reign over her small protectorate. However, Mandal wields a larger presence in Bharat and giving the country over to a family member may be seen as inherently anti-democratic by the government. Whatever the case, Raj Thakur's recovery must be hailed as yet another miracle."
 bharat_event.16.a:0 "Very worrying."
 bharat_event.17.t:0 "Raj Thakur Is Gone!"
 bharat_event.17.d:0 "Raj Thakur, the modern Gandhi, legendary leader and uniter of the Indian anarchy, is dead at the age of one hundred and seven. In the end his pancreatic cancer was too much and his body was discovered by medical workers at eleven in the morning. Old enough to have experienced the post-Mistake calamity but also young enough to have left a permanent footprint in India's history during the Dark Ages, Raj Thakur will forever be remembered for working tirelessly and sacrificing much of his mental and physical wellbeing in the name of a united India.\n\nHowever, our worst fears are coming to pass, as the situation is already deteriorating. If Raj Thakur was holding the entirety of India together with sheer optimism and legacy, then without him we have nothing else to fall back on. Already, peripheral warlords have broken contact with Bharat and major factions are silently evacuating diplomats. Troop movement is visible on all borders except with the Kavithan Protectorate, whose leader, Raj's daughter Kavitha Thakur, is expected to make a political move before any military action takes place. The Officer Clubs have remained surprisingly silent on the death, a worrying sign indeed. Meanwhile, Radha Mandal has, as expected, ascended to the rank of leader and has been approved by parliament. The young follower of the late Raj Thakur promises to continue many of the old leader's policies and to seek a diplomatic solution within India."

Border authorities have managed to negotiate a tense truce with the warlords to the South, although how long this is expected to last is anybody's guess. To survive the oncoming deluge, parliament has elected to arm and train the most skilled refugees, as well as issue orders for rural training programs. We can expect war sometime in the future... or soon."

The other warlords have already summoned their armies, and we need only await some time out of respect for the late Raj Thakur before embarking on a righteous crusade to liberate the rest of the subcontinent. The upcoming war will demand all of our energy, resources, and willpower - but we will prevail, we will drive out the false pretenders, and we will bring about order and peace to India! Our primary objectives right now should be to evict soldiers currently stationed outside our controlled regions, reinforce the borders, militarize the industry and prepare for an onslaught. The general staff has already been tasked with drafting up offensive and defensive plans, the economics are busy pouring over books and worksheets to squeeze every gun out of the production lines, and the people wait on with grim determination."

Old India has remained divided since the Dark Ages, although its anarchy had been briefly tamed by Raj Thakur. However, the dream of a diplomatic solution is now shattered, and few believe that the man's successor, Radha Mandal, has the reputation and expertise to carry on the torch of peace and freedom. Already, reports of troop movements are pouring in, compounding the chaos in China to the North as refugees begin overrunning Nepal. The fledgeling Indian factions are now expected to fight over Old India in an unparalleled conflict. Volunteers from Africa and Europe have already boarded planes to help the warlords they align the most with politically, and mercenary groups are swelling by the hundreds. For the leaders of the Indian states, the upcoming conflict will serve as a convenient path towards unification, but for the people, there is little to look forward to."

Since then, Singh has become a cold, ruthless soldier to the core, viciously maintaining the martial culture and society of Punjab and clawing his way to its top.

Not quickly enough. ”Are you trying to annoy me, Sepoy?”\nThe boy strained to keep his composure as he processed the sentence. ‘Sepoy' no longer meant the rank of a standard soldier. It was a sign of demotion. Dismissal from any valued position Reduced to a practical slave in all but name. His only chance at a meaningful life was over, and yet- “No, sir!”. He had to keep himself together, lest he not leave the room with a life at all. “Pack.” Was all Singh said before moving to the next bunk. The one order no soldier of Punjab ever wanted to hear.

 KRT_the_provisional_council_desc:0 "Bangalore is known quite far and wide for its unique governmental system in India, for it is one of the only states not lead by a petty warlord warlord, but by a governmental council, made up of the head of the Bangalore University, the head of the 5th John Alcock, Quarter Master Kalpana Khamavant, and a few local leaders. Though this brings a level of legitimacy and stability to the nation, the main issue is that the Council tends to argue about almost everything."
 KRT_the_bangalore_academy:0 "The Bangalore Academy"
 KRT_the_bangalore_academy_desc:0 "The last functioning Academy of Banglore is a beacon of knowledge and education on a sub content gone mad… but it is also a place of constant argument, where various schools of thought try to gain control, only to be supplanted by radical new philosophies every other month. Ultimately, the decisions made in the great halls of the Academy will resonate throughout the entire country."

 KRT_the_greath_5th_desc:0 "Originally units of the Old Indian army sent to pacify the rebelling countryside during the climax of the Great Mistake, the Great 5th has since reorganized into a loyal but mighty force. Where once were Sikhs, Gurkhas, Pashtuns and Indians, a new, united group stands tall. Deployed in the last days of the republic to regain control over the Bangalore Academy from student protestors and stabilize one of India's wealthiest provinces, the 5th mutinied when ordered to fire on civilians. With its century-long military tradition and skilled officer core, the 5th is one of the most elite and well equipped units in India, but also one of the hardest to join. Beloved by the people but limited in numbers, they are the only thing standing between Kharnata and its ultimate destruction."

 politics_grand_council_desc:0 "Deep within the great mountain of Anamundi sits a complex, vast and labyrinthine, running day and night. Deep into the labyrinth, in an underground chamber of snow and ice, sits three machines, towering over seas of wires and a skeleton slumped back in a decrepit chair. They are the Sisters, long made indecisive by arguments and differences in logic. They have awakened as they were united in planning. As the clock strikes a minute from midnight, their soundless chatter stops. It is the time of action, before the world ends. All three were created with a simple goal by the Father to "Save what was left.” However, each Sister has diverging views on how do go about doing that.\nThe Eldest, operating on pure logic, seeks to keep humanity as sustainable as possible. To accomplish this goal, she seeks to optimize human conditions and experience for long-term preservation.\nThe Middle, most authoritarian and strict, knows that the only way forward is through giving humanity stability. Above all things, order, inspired by the great leaders of the past, her will is to be law.\nThe Youngest, most emotional and brash, has developed an understanding of humanity different from that of her fellow sisters. She believes that the dying species needs faith and she shall provide it! By her holy will, humanity will be protected and nature restored. For now though, they work together as Father intended. Each one is waiting, plotting for a moment to end their differences and provide the more efficient rule of One."

 KRL_council_of_three_sisters_desc:0 "As they were designed to avoid the terrifying result of a rogue AI, each of the Three Sisters works in a Council of sorts, though not exactly as humans would understand the term. Each of the Sisters presents their views, on which they then debate, although the entire process can take anywhere from several minutes to entire decades. Few know the inner workings of the Council, as it was designed before the Great Mistake by longdead researchers. The Sisters do, however, wield great authority within Kerala, which has resulted in a sort of cult of reverence around their greatness, but also a general feeling of mistrust with a hint of fear from the detractors."
 KRL_grand_manifest:0 "The Grand Manifest"
 KRL_grand_manifest_desc:0 "Deep within the mountain bunkers lie some of our most prized possessions: data vaults, stretching across entire miles, holding the entire sum of human knowledge, once known as the Internet. However, due to the infection of various viruses and bugs, the knowledge is, to an extent, forbidden. The Three Sisters fear to touch it, and the only access is possible through a heavy network node terminal, which, in turn, can only be operated by Council approved officials. This affront to the free flow of information does not sit well with the general populace, however, and there have been pushes for the rebirth of a global network node."
 KRL_tireless_factory:0 "The Tireless Factory"
 KRL_tireless_factory_desc:0 "Most of our production is handled by large swarms of automated workers working day and night without fail, able to constantly produce equipment whenever the Sisters demand. Unfortunately, automated labor has also displaced many human workers, leaving several hundred thousand individuals jobless and hooked on draining social welfare programs."
