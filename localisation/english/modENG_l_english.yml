 ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia:0 "The Sick Man of Britannia"
 ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia_desc:0 "In 2200, England is a starkly divided nation. It began as ignorance when the Thames began to climb, and the official response was to just put a wall around it. By the time London was drowning, the wolves revealed themselves. Now, England's new capital in Birmingham has met almost a century of inefficient, contentious rule, and anyone can feel the rising tension. The vultures circle overhead, and England's fate rests on the shoulders of foreign powers."
 ENG_stagnant_republican_army:0 "Stagnant Republican Army"
 ENG_stagnant_republican_army_desc:0 "When a limping England was accepted into the North Sea Alliance, the nation breathed a sigh of relief…and immediately cut its military funding to prop up its struggling economy. With the burden of defence placed on its new allies, England's coffers flooded elsewhere as she struggled to stand on her own two feet again. Though the Republican Army still exists, its equipment and methods are woefully outdated, and despite the severe state of the nation, diverting any funds to restore the army is not going to come without a lot of opposition."
 ENG_incompetent_parliament:0 "Incompetent Parliament"
 ENG_incompetent_parliament_desc:0 "Ever since Parliament relocated to Birmingham, the change seems to have only ramped up their childish incompetence. Petty issues consume days in needless debate, funds for lifesaving aid are going to the vices of lying MPs, and things actually getting done are cause for national celebration. Same as it ever was, yet somehow worse."

 ENG_civil_war_recovery:0 "Recovering from the English Civil War"
 ENG_civil_war_recovery_desc:0 "England’s wounds are fresh and bloody. Though the war is won, the social and physical damage to the nation is extensive and brutal. The populace must be reinvigorated and given reason to trust us, and the damage to our industry and infrastructure must be repaired post-haste."

 ENG_barbara_taylor:0 "Barbara Taylor"
 ENG_barbara_taylor_desc:0 "The "New Labour Party" of Barbara Taylor desperately scrambles to catch the pieces of a crumbling state alongside their benefactors in the Highlands. With Taylor herself, a union worker before her time in politics, at the helm of a government who spends its time squabbling and sitting blinded within the confines of the city of Birmingham, she is the one the population blames for the decades of inadequacy and incompetence, and her efforts to correct course and save the nation from despair may only tip it over the edge.\n\nAdvocates of industrial renewal and embracement of the future, it is the Masterist decree that England can only survive if it is to push ahead with vigour, a stiff upper lip and the recovery and alteration of what remains. After all, the Industrial Revolution was born in Birmingham, and so, one might hope, a Masterist Revolution may yet march on from there too."
 ENG_arthur_barr:0 "Arthur Burr"
 ENG_arthur_barr_desc:0 "Arthur Burr is a man of eccentric character, but solemn, grounded resolve. When his family's modest fishing life was replaced by the roar of a new, Scottish-made Industrial Trawler, he grew to resent the ruling party and its industrial overlords in the Highlands.\n\nWhen his mother was sick and dying, and the medicine to save her life was unavailable when an English Spring protest had its manufacturer closed down, he rejected the idealism of the Harmonists.\n\nWhen he was poor and living in a Newcastle slum, an English Front rally beat him to unconsciousness when seeing his prosthetic hand that replaced the one lost to an industrial accent, he cast out the blind hatred of the Purist.\n\nAnd so, to Arthur, the world had betrayed him. But the eccentric Burr would not let the world around him bring him to ruin. To, as an old adage put it, “Keep Calm and Carry On”. It was this determination that brought him to others like him who held similar tales. Similar disdain for factionalism. For the low that decades of rule had brought them to, and the danger that the alternatives might sink them even lower. But unlike his comrades, nihilism was not enough for Arthur Burr. He sought to do something about the world around him, and so rallied his supporters behind what he described as "Cavalierism". He did not fight for an ideology or a foreign benefactor. He fought for England. He did not espouse harsh Masterism or naive Harmonism. He espoused the spirit of England. He did not hope for a technological salvation, nor did he hope for an impossible recovery. He hoped for England, and that her people might finally see the error of their ways. That England might finally stand on her own two feet and proclaim herself a sovereign, free land, even after the decades of blood, toil, tears and sweat."
 ENG_cassie_kenney:0 "Cassie Kenney"
 ENG_cassie_kenney_desc:0 "England is not dying, England died a long time ago. England died with the drowning of London. England died when the rest of the world died. Yet there are those in power who seek to escape drowning by tying an anchor to their feet. There are warmongers who would subjugate these fair, floundering isles. There are fools who would refuse to release their pride for the good of the people.\n\nCassie Kenney hails from a valley in Lancashire. Or rather, she once did, before her home had flooded six times in a decade. Before the government's inaction left her family without food, water or electricity. Before a starving young teenager beat her boyfriend to death in the night when they were robbed, only for the burglar to find an empty fridge. Before the desolation forced her to move to Birmingham, where she saw the fire of industry burning bright. Cassie did not blame the teenager for her boyfriend's death, just as she does not blame the river for rising. She saw the problem at its core. The government. The "Masterists". The people who continued to poison the land, even as it was sinking beneath them. Cassie founded the Lancashire section of the Spring Party, but only a year later, she was voted as the leader of the entire, nationwide party. She saw the path forward, and it would not be through inaction.\n\nEngland's corpse is blindfolded, but the Spring can see it through the dark. It is all they can hope for."
 ENG_nigel_john_hall:0 "Nigel John-Hall"
 ENG_nigel_john_hall_desc:0 "What is England anymore? England is a bloated corpse, and all around, it is defiled. The so-called "New Labour Party" attaches machines and lights to watch it twitch. The "Harmonists" seek to decorate it with flowers and pretend all is well, and the "Cavaliers" would perform a ritual of salt and candle to resurrect it.\n\nNo. England is long-dead, and only the great can avenge her.\n\nEnter Nigel John-Hall, founder of the English Front, Republican Army veteran and, according to the "government" in charge, now designated a terrorist. He, who wishes to lead England free of her course of degeneracy and technological rape. He, who fought for the people and received a pension of trinkets and meaningless praise. He, Nigel Barton Ibrahim John-Hall, a terrorist.\n\nNo. They are the terrorists. The defilers of English pride and beauty. The match is struck, and England will crawl from this black abyss, or Nigel will fall screaming with it."

 england_event.1.t: "The Birmingham Uproar"
 england_event.1.d: "It began with a few drunken old men in a Birmingham pub. As is English tradition, they would typically have voiced their distaste of the state of affairs to one another, and then done nothing more. But now, that tradition had passed by one too many times, and from a few more drinks came a drunken brawl with a police officer on the street. From that brawl came the officer's reinforcements, and from that reinforcement came outraged onlookers to intervene. Soon, the entire local police force was mustered to the area, against the opposition of what looked to be a dozen city blocks, fueled by decades of dissatisfaction and quiet resentment boiling to the surface.\n\nBy the end of the hour, the city was awash with violence. It was not clear to many why exactly they were hurling rocks at police lines or firing rubber bullets over poverty-riddled crowds, as the attention and goal of the crowd was volatile at best. Electric gates had been set up in town squares, with riot pens filled beyond capacity to the point there were riots within the riot pens themselves. Attempts at deploying aerial drones to fire chemicals into the crowd only served to arm them further as rocks, cans and even makeshift cannons made from overcharged B-D tennis ball launchers were used to shoot them out of the sky, those same chemicals being thrown back at the police lines just minutes later. By the late hours, a formal request for use of high-frequency speakers and mass chemical dispersal had been made, but dismissed by the PM personally.\n\nIt was only when the chaos had started to die down that an understanding of the riot's main ideology was ascertained. By the end of the day, the famous statues of Boulton, Watt and Murdoch, founding figures of the industrial revolution, had been…"

 england_event.2.t: "The 2nd English Civil War"
 england_event.2.d: "Violence erupted today on the streets of Birmingham following a slow collapse of central authority by the English Government. After the Great Mistake, England's economy and status as a European power was quick to decline, and in recent years, the nation has become reliant on the North Sea Alliance both politically and economically for stability.\n\nFollowing the eruption of a large riot in the streets of the capital city several months ago, the building tension across the nation has divided the people across several ideological lines. In the east, advocates of the 21st century 'English Spring' seek to rebuild the nation under strong ecological ideals in line with INTEGR. In the Home Counties, frustration with the technological shock of NSA integration has brought rise to a paramilitary of anti-technological militia under ex-general Nigel John-Hall, and in the south, a small force of breakaway militia under MP Arthur Burr hold the regions of Kent and Cornwall.\n\nTime will tell if the old government can withstand the storm, or if England will be swept away under a tide of long-boiling discontent."

 england_event.3.t: "Government Victory in England"
 england_event.3.d: "With the surrender of the last pockets of insurrectionist resistance, the government of Barbara Taylor’s New Labour Party has declared victory in the 2nd English Civil War.\n\nElected several months before the outbreak of fighting, Barbara Taylor was a dark horse among the notoriously stagnant New Parliament in Birmingham, and while some say her attempts at drastic reform only sped up the approach to conflict, the attempt alone places her as an outlier among the long-standing inaction of the New Labour Party. Large scale crackdowns both in the government and across the nation are currently taking place, with heavy industrial revitalisation scheduled in the near future.\n\nIn a brief speech to Parliament, the Prime Minister affirmed her commitments to reform and to the North Sea Alliance. Already, NSA troops are entering the country to help quell lingering resistance, putting to rest any concerns that England may yet slide into the sphere of another European power."
 england_event_option.3.a: "Thank goodness that’s over."
 england_event_option.3.b: "She’s got a lot to answer for."
 england_event_option.3.c: "There goes our beachhead."
 england_event_option.3.d: "That John-Hall couldn't conquer his own living room."
 england_event.4.t: "Out Of The Fire"
 england_event.4.d: "We’ve done it. With the last vestiges of opposition besieged and rooted out of their holes, England is whole again and the government endures.\n\nWhile we must count ourselves fortunate despite the fact it had to come to this, it cannot be understated that our victory here has supplanted our power for the foreseeable future and given us, and the Prime Minister, the opportunity to make fundamental changes that have been desperately needed for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, the release of wartime pressure has resurfaced several old problems. Though the French and German lackeys may have been expunged, the Scottish across the border are less than pleased with our government. While we have promises of continued support and cooperation, we cannot ignore the fact that this government fell into civil war mere months after its founding, and we must restore the NSA’s trust in our leadership if England is to become anything of note."
 england_event_option.4.a: "...and into the frying pan."
 england_event.5.t: "A Moment of Reprieve"
 england_event.5.d: ""Cheers!"\nThe word came out as a surprise to the members of Ms. Taylor’s inner circle. Before and during the civil war, the PM had been an overworked, exhausted husk of a shell who said not a word of anything that wasn’t strictly required for her to say. For her to raise the first glass was perhaps more motivational than they would have expected.\n"To our hard work, our brave army, and the prosperity of England." A rowdy grumble of cheers fell from her associates. The toast was perhaps the first of many to be so honest before the new century. What was once a toast to coffers and personal health, now something for a greater good. Barbara downed half her pint in a few seconds – the first she had allowed herself in months. As the glass sank back to the table, her eyes caught their own gaze in the grimy orange liquid. She fell silent, and contemplative. Thoughts crossed her mind.\n\nIt could have been any other of them sat here right now.\nThat rowdy people pleaser, Kenney.\nThe old oatbag and his luddite maniacs.\nEven Burr, the poor bastard.\n\nBut it was none of them. She focused herself back to reality and took her gaze off her drink, back to her compatriots. Men and women she could trust. Who really cared for England as she did. Now, it was their time. Hers."
 england_event_option.5.a: "Maybe things will be alright."
 england_event.6.t: "The Hopeful"
 england_event.6.d: "Cassandra Kenney was a divisive figure in England. To most before the Civil War, she was a well-meaning, if somewhat radical political figure. After its outbreak, however, she was discredited by many for rising up in armed revolution, overturning democracy for violence. Now, defeated and ashamed, she languishes in a prison in Leeds, her conditions decent, but her connection to her beloved supporters severed like the heart from a body.\n\nThe government would soon decide what was to be done with her. What few letters she could send to the Prime Minister seemed to vary almost manically. In some, she lambasted her captors with excessive punctuation and capital letters, damning them for their betrayal of the planet and its people. In others, her tone is heartfelt and honest, wishing to apologise for casting aside her principles in favour of a violent uprising. She is a conundrum at best, an unstable revolutionary at worst.\n\nAll that remains is what to do with her, and the example that will be set by her fate."
 england_event_option.6.a: "She must be given a life sentence for the death and chaos she has incited."
 england_event_option.6.b: "Her actions were in response to others attempting to seize the nation. Give her a modest sentence."
 england_event_option.6.c: "She will serve a short sentence, under the condition she never involve herself in politics again."
 england_event.7.t: "The Hateful"
 england_event.7.d: "Of all the opposition to the government during the civil war, few were as dangerous and hateful as Nigel John-Hall. His status as an ex-army veteran and his charismatic populism have made him perhaps the single most dangerous man in the country, and even now, imprisoned with his fellow terrorists in Leeds, he makes calls to continue the struggle. Unlike his fellows, John-Hall was not given the opportunity to send any letters nor make any pleas, and his conditions were distinctly worse than most, owing to the general hatred for him outside the ranks of his own fanatical supporters.\n\nThis is hardly a surprise, given the long list of atrocities committed by his forces. While John-Hall himself denies or denounces these actions, the perpetrators themselves undertook them in his name, the most heinous of which included murders committed when vital cybernetic implantations were torn from the bodies of the sick and elderly in their hospital beds, arson of entire street blocks funded by membership in the NSA, and lynching of those with any visible augmentations, not to mention the masses of terroristic strikes against new factories and datalink sites, some of which occurred before the civil war even began.\n\nWe cannot be certain all of these claims are true, but it is impossible to deny the distinct ruthlessness and violence carried out by the English Front’s forces, and many are calling for the harshest possible punishment for their leader."
 england_event_option.7.a: "Make an exception to the death penalty laws, and have him executed by the army for treason. He is a veteran, after all."
 england_event_option.7.b: "He must face a life sentence, as short as that may be."
 england_event_option.7.c: "It pains us to do so, but he still has supporters that we need to appease. Release him and exile him to the French."
 england_event.8.t: "The Dutiful"
 england_event.8.d: "Arthur Burr, still technically a member of Parliament, has found himself an odd case for the government. While currently considered a terrorist, and having undoubtedly led an armed opposition to the government, he still retains a surprising amount of popular sympathy, and compared to other combatants, his ‘Cavalier’ militia have very few accusations of crimes levied against them.\n\nBurr himself writes regular letters from prison in Leeds, many of which call not for continuation of his ideology, but for his supporters to lay down their arms and seek change through reform now that England is stable again. He regularly claims his actions were only in the interest of saving the country from violent extremists, and despite his blatant disdain for our leadership, he claims to be at least grateful that we were the ones to triumph, and not any other. He has even recently sent a letter to the Prime Minister herself, formally apologising for his opposition and seemingly throwing around the idea of returning to Parliament.\n\nDespite his claims of good-heartedness and his admittedly clean record, it cannot be forgotten that this man was willing to lead an armed opposition to our government when the nation was in crisis, but the benefits of his acquittal, and of extending an olive branch to his support base must be considered."
 england_event_option.8.a: "Mr. Burr’s record may be mostly clean, but we cannot stomach opposition at a time like this. He will remain in prison."
 england_event_option.8.b: "His actions must still be answered for. A short sentence and suspension from politics will put the troublemaker away."
 england_event_option.8.c: "His ‘Cavalierism’ isn’t all that harmful of a concept. Release him, and reinstate him as a member of Parliament."
 england_event.9.t: "Matters of Employment"
 england_event.9.d: "Barbara lay splayed out on her bed, the shutdown jingle of her tablet echoing in her mind, and in the silence of her bedroom, the ceiling had never felt so exciting to stare at. Finally, the back breaking work was over. New authority had been handed out across England, the matter of the opposition had been settled, provisional authority was being relinquished, and the country was slowly returning to a status quo.\n\nIt felt like a lifetime ago that she had been hearing the first hints of news about a small scuffle in Birmingham. Ever since that point, she had been tumbling arse-up, down a hill of smoke and blood. But now, she had reached a plateau. Stability. The word seemed so luscious and tender, she could hardly believe it to be a state one could achieve. But here they were. Safe. Stable. A moment of bloody peace.\n\nHer phone rang, and she could swear she felt a vein burst. She let it ring for a few moments. Just to imprint into her mind what it felt like to actually be laying in a bed. Then, once she had enough of a taste of peace to torment herself, she rolled over to the nightstand and picked up her phone.\n\n’D. Hughes.’ She had only spoken to him intermittently over the course of the war. At least then, she had the excuse to cut the call whenever something ‘important’ came up. Or whenever she was just sick of his blunt attitude. But now, there was nothing. He was catching her with nothing else to occupy her time, and he surely knew it.\n\nShe let the phone ring right up until it would have gone to voicemail, and only then did she answer. From the depths of her soul, she summoned a pleasant voice that had no right to exist."
 england_event_option.9.a: ""...Mr. Hughes!""
  #england_event.10.t: "The Lost Jewel"
  #england_event.10.d: "Before the gradual decline of England into corrupt complacency and unrest, ambitious plans had been made by joint NSA research and engineering teams for a project that could recover much of England’s lost history, pride and industry, known by its experimental name as an ‘ARK’ Project. Similar plans are a hallmark of the NSA’s goals and ambitions for the future - to rebuild Europe and recover her lost cities.\n\nAnd London, fate willing, would be among them.\n\nThere now lies the question, however, of who will fund and construct this ambitious work. Though England may be free from her turmoil for the moment, the Scottish role in our victory is not to be understated, and they will surely be looking for a piece of this lucrative investment. While Scottish cooperation is to be expected in this project, we must be sure that a new London does not lie in the pockets of over-involved foreigners."
  #england_event_option.10.a: "Let the project resume."

 england_event.11.t: "Frontist Victory in England"
 england_event.11.d: "What seems to be the end of a long-dying English democracy is cemented as the paramilitaries of the English Front proclaim victory in the 2nd English Civil War.\n\nWidely criticised as a populist, ‘anti-progress’ cult of personality, the English Front has been a party founded and led by ex-general, now Marshal Nigel Barton Ibrahim John-Hall. The new Frontist government has already begun extensive crackdowns across the nation, and martial law has yet to be lifted and Parliament, effectively abandoned since the fall of the old government, is expected to be abolished in the coming days, and a new radical military government installed.\n\nThe new government is currently only recognized by Franco-Iberia and its associates, and with the speed of negotiations between the two parties, the mainland European state is expected to assert considerable influence over English foreign policy, the two having already signed a defensive agreement. With stirrings in Ireland from supporters of John-Hall’s fanatically anti-technological ideology and his aggressive rhetoric toward the other alliances of Europe, however, they may find their new pet resentful of its leash."
 england_event_option.11.a: "The Front marches on!"
 england_event_option.11.b: "The Industrial Revolution dies where it started."
 england_event_option.11.c: "Marching forward, moving backwards."
 england_event_option.11.d: "Now get in there before he does any more damage."
 england_event.12.t: "Out Of The Fire"
 england_event.12.d: "We’ve done it. With the last vestiges of opposition besieged and rooted out of their holes, England is whole again and the government endures.\n\nWhile we must count ourselves fortunate despite the fact it had to come to this, it cannot be understated that our victory here has supplanted our power for the foreseeable future and given us, and the Marshal, the opportunity to make fundamental changes that have been desperately needed for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, the release of wartime pressure has resurfaced several old problems. Though the Scottish and German lackeys may have been sent back to their masters, England is battered and bleeding, and we still have the matter of the Franco-Iberians to contend with. They are no doubt grateful for our victory, but they will surely be expecting very close cooperation with us. Though they may be allies of circumstance, our methods of government are very different, and they may not see eye to eye with our ideas of technological purity. They will press hard, but we must not break to their influence. We will cooperate, but we will not be subjugated."
 england_event_option.12.a: "...and into the frying pan."
 england_event.13.t: "A Moment of Triumph"
 england_event.13.d: "Nigel’s presence at these war cabinet meetings had always been more of a formality recently. Every day, he simply checked in, bid his cronies a stiff salute, and went to check on the frontline map. He’d make his strategic interests known, and be off for tea not long after. In the war’s early days, not a corporal could cough without Mr. Hall’s approval, and he had frequently been persuaded away from being flown down to the field to see the developments firsthand. Now, however, the war was a sure thing. A meaningless game - his participation only as a symbol of respect to his fellow commanders. Would be awfully rude to simply jog on once things were looking good, after all.\n\n"Marshal John-Hall, sir." His personal aide rushed through the set of open doors. The boy was fortunate to keep his job - any heartless un-English blaggard would have replaced him with a drone decades ago.\n\n"Ah?" Nigel bleated out, craning his head up from the map. He cast a glare at the young man once he noticed the sheepish smile on his face.\n\n"We did it, sir." Nigel was just about to reprimand the young man for his vagueness when he continued. "All their remaining garrisons have been given the order to stand down, sir."\n\nA raucous cheer echoed through the war room. Men raised their fists, bumped their chests, and two old comrades even shared a rowdy headbutt. Yet in the middle of the room, arms still spread over his map…Nigel was almost motionless. His gaze was fixed into the little lights on his map board. Troop positions. Artillery. Air forces. And it all suddenly felt…\n\n…He wasn’t sure how to describe it. He didn’t like the feeling, and scrambled for something to explain it away. To make him want to cheer as the others were. It was then that it struck him. He hadn’t thought this far ahead. Did he even expect to get here? Surely.\n\nHe looked up to see his cronies, their cheers silenced and their postures stiffened, surely cowed by his own hesitance to celebrate. It did him good, he surmised. For them to know he wasn’t all pumped fists and rowdy yells. Yet as he dismissed them with his signature wave of the wrist, his gaze fell back to his map. To England, and the worries of running a nation rather than an army."
 england_event_option.13.a: "It can’t be all that different, right?"
 england_event.14.t: "The French?"
 england_event.14.d: ""What about the French?" Nigel paced in a ring through his house, as he often did in these mundane phone calls. "Franco-Iberians- whatever you want to call them. Ruddy stupid name." Someone had needed to explain to him how Franco-Iberia wasn’t just the French. It had promptly summoned questions about what on earth Iberia had to do with it, which had then launched into a discussion on modern European history, which Nigel had ended about a tenth of the way into.\n\n"Yes? And?" He was only really understanding half of anything his foreign secretary had said - the rural Welsh accent was not a tune Nigel understood very clearly. "And what obligations did we agree to?" He stopped in the lounge, sat on the arm of his armchair. His eyes glazed over to an old picture. Himself and James, his dear departed husband. He wondered if he’d be proud.\n\nHis mental wandering caused him to miss half of what was being droned into his ear. "Yes- yes! We’ll just-...what- what is a holo-call!? I’ll be damned if I’m being holo-ified on anything!"\n\nAnother pause. He understood that he and these ‘France-Iberians’ didn’t see eye to eye on matters of technological impurity, but a ‘holo-call’? What even was that? He’d seen holo-grams before, on great billboards paid for by ‘North Sea Alliance investment’, or as he liked to call it, Scotfund. But this was- "Fine!" It croaked out in a blurt of exasperation. "I’ll take a video call if I have to! Yes! Thank you- goodbye!" He angrily wrangled with the touchscreen on his phone for a moment before giving up and just turning the damned thing off, sinking back into his armchair."
 england_event_option.14.a: "What happened to good old fashioned emails?"
 england_event.15.t: "The Hopeful"
 england_event.15.d: "Of the many prisoners taken following our victory in the Civil War, few were as loud and angry as Cassandra Kenney. Following an ill-fated decision to remain in the Spring Party’s capital, she was promptly captured by militia forces, and managed to evade being killed only due to a case of mistaken identity. Now, however, many of our men are wishing she’d been put down at the first opportunity.\n\nMs. Kenney was initially provided with a decent cell in a Leeds prison, but following several un-heeded warnings and reprimands, she has been relocated to a P.O.W camp in Oxfordshire, where she continues to rant and rave at any EF authority figure she can get her hands on. Even after several rounds of beatings and solitary confinement, her creative vocabulary and virile anger remained undeterred, often cursing out high ranking figures in the English Front, and most of the time, Nigel John-Hall himself despite the two not having met since the war began.\n\nNow that more pressing matters have been settled, the question remains of what to do with Ms. Kenney. Her opposition, though in similar hatred of the old government to ours, is sorely misguided and puppeted by German overlords, and her unpredictable nature makes her an awkward question at best."
 england_event_option.15.a: "Her unpredictability is far too dangerous to be tolerated, no matter where we put her. She’ll face a show trial for treason, and a firing squad."
 england_event_option.15.b: "We can’t risk letting her be free abroad. Send her back to Leeds, and perhaps make that cell soundproof."
 england_event_option.15.c: "Send her to the Germans. Let them deal with her screeching and wailing."
 england_event.16.t: "The Blameful"
 england_event.16.d: "The old government was a weak and ineffectual system. For decades, England slid backwards into obscurity, poverty and despair because of their inaction. Their corruption, and their selling out to foreign power. Their desperate outreach to the NSA was the last straw for many - what few jobs remained in the nation were outsourced to Scottish businesses or made obsolete by vile new equipment with no care for the good English workers that they sent into slums and onto the streets.\n\nNow, that government is no more, and the idol of its failure, Barbara Taylor, languishes in a prison cell. Guards report of her unusually silent and sedentary demeanour, only following orders given and saying next to nothing to those around her. Even when our guards would try to pry a response out of her and in the event of beatings, she seemed unchanged. Now, the time has come to make a decision on her fate. A figurehead of nearly a century of failure, the people are watching closely."
 england_event_option.16.a: "The English people require justice for her government’s wrongdoings. The sentence shall be a swift death."
 england_event_option.16.b: "She will remain in prison for the rest of her days. Let her sleep them away if she wants."
 england_event_option.16.c: "She serves no purpose to England anymore. Send her to Scotland and let them have their lackey back."

 england_event.18.t: "Civil Debate"
 england_event.18.d: ""You’d sell us out straight to Hughes with those standards!" General Jade Bowley’s thick, gruff voice was distinct over the rest of the cabinet of army officials, influential sympathizers and other men of the inner circle. "People need that equipment to survive! You’d have them fight cancer with thoughts and prayers!" The uptight, clean but consistently malicious tone of Harker Evans, Millionaire Entrepreneur turned Minister for Employment, struck back with pinpoint precision. Even before the civil war, discussions on the intensity of technological persecution were a smouldering ember waiting to catch alight. To some, it was simply a matter of moderation. To keep the advances of the modern day in check and preserve the current values and practices. To others, it seemed more like a cult where any form of technology that didn’t date back to the 21st Century was inexcusably and uncompromisingly evil under all circumstances.\n\nIn the back, Nigel John-Hall, as always, sitting on his chair as the discussion fell to heated bawling. It was good for them to get their frustrations out in front of him. Like an unknowingly dose of alcohol, the tension loosened their tongues and showed their real values. He took notes in his head as he watched them, head resting on his joined hands, eyes cast up at them. What subjects drove each of them to raise their voices higher. Where they stuttered as they caught themselves before saying something they would have regretted. It taught him what each of them really wanted from throwing their lot in with the Front. How far they were willing to go.\n\n"Gentlemen." It was all Nigel had to say, and the discourse ended immediately. No man in the room was willing to contest with their leader, no matter their fervour. It was a perfect balance of loyalty and ignorant transparency. Just how he wanted it."

 england_event_option.19.a: "We do not tolerate misinformation."
 england_event.20.t: "Au Revoir"
 england_event.20.d: "It was perhaps to be expected, given the recent, radical political changes in Franco-Iberia, that lines of communication would need to be re-established. Supplies would stutter and there’d be a few awkward exchanges at least. But eventually, it was expected, things would return to normal. The supplies shipments would resume and life would go on.\n\nIt has been two weeks, and not a single phone call has reached our government.\n\nNo matter how we try to contact them, our calls have been uselessly diverted or outright ignored, and all forms of cooperation have ceased. It’s too late now for any reasonable explanation for this.\n\nWe have been abandoned."
 england_event_option.20.a: "The vultures circle."
 england_event.21.t: "Our Final Stand"
 england_event.21.d: "This is it. Scottish forces have launched an assault against our border garrisons, and all signs point to an invasion. Our old allies have abandoned us, and the vultures are swooping in. England will endure, or she will drown in a sea of technological enslavement and corrupt stagnation once more. English spirits must be high, and English valour brought to bear. We will show the invader what it means to cross the unleashed spirit of the nation! For England and the Front!"
 england_event_option.21.a: "Marshal John-Hall will save us!"
 england_event.22.t: "The European Front"
 england_event.22.d: "It is done. Against all odds, the spirit of England has triumphed. Marshal John-Hall now holds dominion across Britannia, and the whole of the North Sea. The world thought it couldn't be done. The treacherous Franco-Iberians saw us as a rotten limb to be cast away. But no longer. We need no foreign masters to prop up our might.\n\nThe nation is freed from technological tyranny and enforced obsolescence, and now we hold the power to show the world a new future. A future where labour is done with honest hands and hearts, and not replaced by hunks of metal. A future where any man, woman or child can call themselves a carpenter. A farmer. A tailor. Where honest, hard labour is not outclassed by the churning of factory lines.\n\nTo this end, a new state shall be born to lead this charge. A powerful, renewed Britain that wields its own might in its own two hands. Onwards, for the cause, for the Marshal, and for the new European Front!"
