  POL_dyzek_bazinsz_desc:0 "No one embodies the ‘Nowa Polska’ like Dyzek Bazinsz. Born to a Latvian family displaced after the flooding of Riga. He started life as a mechanic in the outskirts of Lublin, a habitual nihilist and chronic pessimist, he saw little hope for his lot in life. However, the first INTEGR rally in Lublin shook him out of his stupor, it amazed him to see people with such passion, such intensity; a fire in every eye and meaning in every word. That rally inspired him to action, to care for the Earth that he had the privilege of being born into, to care for the people of Poland just as the people of Poland had cared for his family when they fled Latvia.\n\nHe would use his savings to secure himself an education in Warsaw University of Technology, during which he would study INTEGR more and more. Studying the shifts in political and cultural thought in Poland, he successfully predicted a shift in INTEGR in Poland towards more spirituality. After completing his degree in bioengineering, he joined INTEGR as a party member. He had already predicted the move towards spirituality and was able to leverage this forecast into a surprisingly successful political career within the party. In 2186, Dyzek had managed to capture the populace’s adoration and climb the ranks of INTEGR well enough to become leader of the Polish Republic. As Dyzek reaches his 3rd term, he seems to be the only member of his party that can see the tensions rising in Europe, and if the past is anything to go by, he’ll be the first to capitalise on it too."

  POL_green_soil_plan_desc:0 "Poland and the Czech Republic were not affected by the Great Mistake with the same intensity compared to other countries or their own neighbour, Germany. For this reason the "Green Soil" plan was signed by these three countries in 2194 with the aim of maintaining a dynamic, mutually supportive and green economy.\n\nSince then, relations between the three countries have only improved. In both countries the Initiative has great social support and is seen as the future of the region and of Europe as a whole.\n\nThe reality is that this treaty has led to an interdependence between the signatory countries, where if the economy of one were to fall, the economy of the other would be seriously affected. That is why the engagement between these countries will be long-lasting and prosperous, as long as the ambitions of European leaders do not get in the way."

  POL_an_unorthodox_orthodoxy_desc:0 "After the Great Mistake, Poland came out relatively unscathed. One side effect of this was an almost ‘time-freeze’ effect on Polish culture, the influence of the catholic church and the more conservative elements of Poland stalling change for a while.\n\nWhen INTEGR came to power in Germany, it coincided with the rise in environmental thought in Poland following the Gdansk Catastrophe. INTEGR soon found an audience in Poland, but to achieve power in the same way they did in Germany, INTEGR - Polska was forced to make peace with the Catholic influence in Poland. INTEGR - Polska isn’t religious in any way, but a sense of spirituality was infused into the rhetoric. Despite fears of abstract thinking ‘watering down’ the INTEGR agenda, the Polish version of INTEGR is arguably even more intense than that of their western neighbour, calling for more drastic actions than even the Germans would. The Green Soil Plan and the Polska-Deutschland Plan likely never would’ve been as effective if it wasn’t for Polish influence."

  POL_powodzenia_desc:0 "Poland was likely one of, if not, the least damaged nation of Europe in the Great Mistake. While the Gdansk Catastrophe lingers in the mind of the populace, generations on, the Polish people haven’t had to deal with the same traumas and obstacles that its neighbours have. While this may be seen as a good thing at first, Poland hasn’t had the true devastation seen in places such as Russia, Germany or England. This is also a bad thing for Poland as a whole, it has made the Poles relatively comfy and naive when compared to Europe as a whole. A common punchline in German political circles is that Poland had a complete social and spiritual revolution after just one city was lost.\n\nThis comfort will only last so long, Europe is on the road to war in the eyes of many, and the current Polish attitude simply seems woefully unprepared for this reality."
