 SIT_battle_of_the_purists_desc:0 "District 7 is undergoing a war, an invisible war, a war in the minds. As the Midwest was relatively unaffected by the Great Mistake, and was too large to fully experience the scars of the Civil Wars and anarchy, its local population has achieved a level of prosperity rarely seen on the continent. This has given way to a noticeable middle and upper class. Even the poorer folks can live in peace, without fear of bandit attacks or famines. This semblance of the old world order has manifested itself in a somewhat politicized populace.\n\nCurrently, the two main competitors for the District's influence are Spencer Morgan, the old general and master administrator who conquered the Midwest during the 3rd American Civil War and saw it prosper, and the alleged usurper, the ARC representative Jensen Laneman. Both men believe in the past, a better past. But as their supporters fight brawls and make large promises, the gap between the two ideologies grows larger. It is inevitable that some major political upset will happen in the near future - the only question is who will come out on top."

 #POLITICS_SPENCER_MORGAN_DESC:0 "Spencer Morgan began his career as an enlistee in the Central army during the early days of the 3rd Civil War. He distinguished himself by leading the famous Littletown Raid, in which he, a dozen footmen and a decrepit walker managed to break through warlord defenses and occupy Littletown, a major stronghold in the Rocky Mountains. This victory pathed the way for Central domination over transportation in the mountain ranges, allowing it to operate across multiple fronts at lightning speeds. Major Morgan went on to participate in critical clashes in California and garnered much fame for his argument against the utilization of nuclear weapons against warlords there. Eventually a colonel and then a general, Spencer Morgan finished his military career at the age of 32 when he successfully pacified the warlord Dangerman in the Midwest.\n\nFor his service, General Morgan was granted authority over District 7. Exchanging the sword for the pen, Morgan proved himself a capable administrator and negotiator. He signed treaties with the local tribes and gangs, bringing much needed order to District 7. His rule saw the creation of entire cities, the resettlement of abandoned lands, and the establishment of a culture fluent in politics. Now an old man, General Morgan has mostly withdrawn from the public sphere. He spends his days secluded in his forest cabin, which has allowed bandits to resurface on the periphery. His supporters have begun to forget the man's contributions and some wonder just how strong his grip over District 7 really is."
 #POLITICS_STEPHEN_QUARITCH_DESC:0 "The amount currently known about Stephen Quaritch by the Central government is next to nothing. The only things they know for certain is that he is really good at killing, really good at turning other people into killers, and that his position as the ARC Chief Security Officer all but makes him immune to prosecution, no matter who he or his “soldiers” kill.  There are a multitude of theories in regards to his backstory, ranging from being a warlord the ARC hired rather than defeat in combat, to being a former member of the runt Naval Junta in Newfoundland. It is almost certain that the ARC has concealed most of Quaritch's background, most likely including his name; although Spencer Morgan attempted to uncover the truth of Quaritch, the latter's takeover of District 7 has undone all the progress into the investigation. If the truth about Quaritch will be revealed, it is clear it will be on his own terms, at the time he chooses..."
