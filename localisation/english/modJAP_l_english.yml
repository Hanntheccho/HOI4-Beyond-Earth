 JAP_street_samurai_desc:0 ""Street Samurai" is a term dating back to ancient popular culture, used to describe international mercenaries with extensive ties to Japan. These hunters are often raised and trained on the islands, armed with Japanese weapons, and sponsored by security-outsourcing agencies. Due to the rapidly deteriorating economic and environmental conditions in Asia, many have enlisted in the ranks of the Street Samurai. Poor folks trying to make ends meet, middle class youth interested in adventure, and even some wealthy individuals have all crossed paths within the GOHK, the state agency for exporting muscle. Unfortunately, this flood of new recruits has brought unsavory individuals with it, ranging from underperforming soldiers to corrupt newcomers."
 JAP_hikaemena_dairiten_desc:0 "The Hikaemena Dairiten, or Under-State Agency, is the successor to the Keiretsus of old. Organized following the Great Mistake, the H-Ds are a cooperation between private and government interests. While theoretically under direct state oversight and supervision, the government rarely exercises its control over them, allowing prominent individuals and interest groups free reign over the H-Ds.\n\nThe most powerful Hikaemena Dairiten is the GOHK, or the Global Security And Protection Agency. Although it (and many others) rose to prominence due to their exportation of Street Samurai to foreign conflicts, other H-Ds have made ventures into finance, infrastructure, medicine, and R&D. Vocal critics of the H-Ds cite their unchecked implied power, but calls for the government to directly involve itself in H-D affairs have gone unanswered."
 JAP_dreams_come_to_life_desc:0 "Japan is renowned the world over for its liberal attitude towards biological and mechanical augmentation. Elites from all over the world flock to the isles in search of new limbs, replacement hearts, and neural uplinks. This business has also made Japan a centerpoint for scientific conventions, further encouraged by the current regime. Japan produces some of the finest augments in the world and even some of its military utilize replacement arms and legs to beat their enemy."
 JAP_emperor_raijingutaido_desc:0 "Emperor Raijingutaido ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2182 A.D. A unifying symbol for a nation that has long abandoned its imperial roots, the people nonetheless enjoy the gossip surrounding the Royal Family and heed the Emperor's advice."

#LEADER
 JAP_iwata_masahiro:0 "Iwata Masahiro"
 JAP_iwata_masahiro_desc:0 "Born into a struggling Tokyo family, Iwata Masahiro spent his youth running deliveries for local food plants and attending local practicality lectures. Japan had still not fully recovered from the Great Mistake then, and Masahiro witnessed the destruction brought about by environmental collapse firsthand. As a teen, he made a vow to ascend to power and repair his homeland after witnessing a local park destroyed by rising tides. Too poor and undereducated to enroll in higher schooling, Masahiro enlisted with reclamation teams for most of his 20's, during which time he built a reputation as a talented and resourceful worker. After receiving a scholarship from the Kubo Michi National Fund, Masahiro earned a degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nOver the following decades, Masahiro traveled the nation as part of the Ayame Keiretsu, over which he took over at the age of 41. Suddenly finding himself one of the richest men in Japan, Iwata Masahiro entered politics as an Innovationist candidate. However, a string of failures and scandals led him to joining the Supremacist NKP, on whose coattails he rose to political office, and eventually became Prime Minister. His regime has been characterized by an emphasis on rebuilding, the promotion of mechanical augmentation, and a reverence for natural parks. Although divided with his own party on certain issues, such as his positive dealings with the Harmonist Innovationists, Iwata Masahiro is still widely seen as a great rebuilding and the architect of modern Japan."

Projects ranging from mind control to gigantic death robots abound on the drawing tables of ostracized scientists, who eagerly await funding that may never come.\n\nThus, a collection of wealthy businessmen (and businesswomen) have pooled their resources to help create a Meka, a towering behemoth of a walker to be used in combat situations. Although military minds have protested this "unprompted waste of funding needed elsewhere", the funders are resolute in their goal to create a massive beacon of Japanese power on the land. Having contracted Fukui Mari, a former Tokyo University researcher, the funders expect the project to be finished within a few years.\n\n-Factories Dedicated: §O[?JAP_meka_factories]§!\n-Meka Parts Finished: §O[?JAP_meka_parts]§!"
