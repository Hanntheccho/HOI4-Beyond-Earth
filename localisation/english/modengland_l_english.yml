 ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia:0 "The Sick Man of Britannia"
 ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia_desc:0 "In 2200, England is a starkly divided nation. It began as ignorance when the Thames began to climb, and the official response was to just put a wall around it. By the time London was drowning, the wolves revealed themselves. Now, England’s new capital in Birmingham has met almost a century of inefficient, contentious rule, and anyone can feel the rising tension. The vultures circle overhead, and England’s fate rests on the shoulders of foreign powers."
 ENG_stagnant_republican_army:0 "Stagnant Republican Army"
 ENG_stagnant_republican_army_desc:0 "When a limping England was accepted into the North Sea Alliance, the nation breathed a sigh of relief…and immediately cut its military funding to prop up its struggling economy. With the burden of defence placed on its new allies, England’s coffers flooded elsewhere as she struggled to stand on her own two feet again. Though the Republican Army still exists, its equipment and methods are woefully outdated, and despite the severe state of the nation, diverting any funds to restore the army is not going to come without a lot of opposition."
 ENG_incompetent_parliament:0 "Incompetent Parliament"
 ENG_incompetent_parliament_desc:0 "Ever since Parliament relocated to Birmingham, the change seems to have only ramped up their childish incompetence. Petty issues consume days in needless debate, funds for lifesaving aid are going to the vices of lying MPs, and things actually getting done are cause for national celebration. Same as it ever was, yet somehow worse."
