 ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia:0 "The Sick Man of Britannia"
 ENG_the_sick_man_of_britannia_desc:0 "In 2200, England is a starkly divided nation. It began as ignorance when the Thames began to climb, and the official response was to just put a wall around it. By the time London was drowning, the wolves revealed themselves. Now, England's new capital in Birmingham has met almost a century of inefficient, contentious rule, and anyone can feel the rising tension. The vultures circle overhead, and England's fate rests on the shoulders of foreign powers."
 ENG_stagnant_republican_army:0 "Stagnant Republican Army"
 ENG_stagnant_republican_army_desc:0 "When a limping England was accepted into the North Sea Alliance, the nation breathed a sigh of relief…and immediately cut its military funding to prop up its struggling economy. With the burden of defence placed on its new allies, England's coffers flooded elsewhere as she struggled to stand on her own two feet again. Though the Republican Army still exists, its equipment and methods are woefully outdated, and despite the severe state of the nation, diverting any funds to restore the army is not going to come without a lot of opposition."
 ENG_incompetent_parliament:0 "Incompetent Parliament"
 ENG_incompetent_parliament_desc:0 "Ever since Parliament relocated to Birmingham, the change seems to have only ramped up their childish incompetence. Petty issues consume days in needless debate, funds for lifesaving aid are going to the vices of lying MPs, and things actually getting done are cause for national celebration. Same as it ever was, yet somehow worse."

 #Leaders
 ENG_barbara_taylor:0 "Barbara Taylor"
 ENG_barbara_taylor_desc:0 "The "New Labour Party" of Barbara Taylor desperately scrambles to catch the pieces of a crumbling state alongside their benefactors in the Highlands. With Taylor herself, a union worker before her time in politics, at the helm of a government who spends its time squabbling and sitting blinded within the confines of the city of Birmingham, she is the one the population blames for the decades of inadequacy and incompetence, and her efforts to correct course and save the nation from despair may only tip it over the edge.\n\nAdvocates of industrial renewal and embracement of the future, it is the Masterist decree that England can only survive if it is to push ahead with vigour, a stiff upper lip and the recovery and alteration of what remains. After all, the Industrial Revolution was born in Birmingham, and so, one might hope, a Masterist Revolution may yet march on from there too."
 ENG_arthur_barr:0 "Arthur Burr"
 ENG_arthur_barr_desc:0 "Arthur Burr is a man of eccentric character, but solemn, grounded resolve. When his family's modest fishing life was replaced by the roar of a new, Scottish-made Industrial Trawler, he grew to resent the ruling party and its industrial overlords in the Highlands.\n\nWhen his mother was sick and dying, and the medicine to save her life was unavailable when an English Spring protest had its manufacturer closed down, he rejected the idealism of the Harmonists.\n\nWhen he was poor and living in a Newcastle slum, an English Front rally beat him to unconsciousness when seeing his prosthetic hand that replaced the one lost to an industrial accent, he cast out the blind hatred of the Purist.\n\nAnd so, to Arthur, the world had betrayed him. But the eccentric Burr would not let the world around him bring him to ruin. To, as an old adage put it, “Keep Calm and Carry On”. It was this determination that brought him to others like him who held similar tales. Similar disdain for factionalism. For the low that decades of rule had brought them to, and the danger that the alternatives might sink them even lower. But unlike his comrades, nihilism was not enough for Arthur Burr. He sought to do something about the world around him, and so rallied his supporters behind what he described as "Cavalierism". He did not fight for an ideology or a foreign benefactor. He fought for England. He did not espouse harsh Masterism or naive Harmonism. He espoused the spirit of England. He did not hope for a technological salvation, nor did he hope for an impossible recovery. He hoped for England, and that her people might finally see the error of their ways. That England might finally stand on her own two feet and proclaim herself a sovereign, free land, even after the decades of blood, toil, tears and sweat."
 ENG_cassie_kenney:0 "Cassie Kenney"
 ENG_cassie_kenney_desc:0 "England is not dying, England died a long time ago. England died with the drowning of London. England died when the rest of the world died. Yet there are those in power who seek to escape drowning by tying an anchor to their feet. There are warmongers who would subjugate these fair, floundering isles. There are fools who would refuse to release their pride for the good of the people.\n\nCassie Kenney hails from a valley in Lancashire. Or rather, she once did, before her home had flooded six times in a decade. Before the government's inaction left her family without food, water or electricity. Before a starving young teenager beat her boyfriend to death in the night when they were robbed, only for the burglar to find an empty fridge. Before the desolation forced her to move to Birmingham, where she saw the fire of industry burning bright. Cassie did not blame the teenager for her boyfriend's death, just as she does not blame the river for rising. She saw the problem at its core. The government. The "Masterists". The people who continued to poison the land, even as it was sinking beneath them. Cassie founded the Lancashire section of the Spring Party, but only a year later, she was voted as the leader of the entire, nationwide party. She saw the path forward, and it would not be through inaction.\n\nEngland's corpse is blindfolded, but the Spring can see it through the dark. It is all they can hope for."
 ENG_nigel_john_hall:0 "Nigel John-Hall"
 ENG_nigel_john_hall_desc:0 "What is England anymore? England is a bloated corpse, and all around, it is defiled. The so-called "New Labour Party" attaches machines and lights to watch it twitch. The "Harmonists" seek to decorate it with flowers and pretend all is well, and the "Cavaliers" would perform a ritual of salt and candle to resurrect it.\n\nNo. England is long-dead, and only the great can avenge her.\n\nEnter Nigel John-Hall, founder of the English Front, Republican Army veteran and, according to the "government" in charge, now designated a terrorist. He, who wishes to lead England free of her course of degeneracy and technological rape. He, who fought for the people and received a pension of trinkets and meaningless praise. He, Nigel Barton Ibrahim John-Hall, a terrorist.\n\nNo. They are the terrorists. The defilers of English pride and beauty. The match is struck, and England will crawl from this black abyss, or Nigel will fall screaming with it."

 #Events
 england_event.1.t:0 "The Birmingham Uproar"
 england_event.1.d:0 "It began with a few drunken old men in a Birmingham pub. As is English tradition, they would typically have voiced their distaste of the state of affairs to one another, and then done nothing more. But now, that tradition had passed by one too many times, and from a few more drinks came a drunken brawl with a police officer on the street. From that brawl came the officer's reinforcements, and from that reinforcement came outraged onlookers to intervene. Soon, the entire local police force was mustered to the area, against the opposition of what looked to be a dozen city blocks, fueled by decades of dissatisfaction and quiet resentment boiling to the surface.\n\nBy the end of the hour, the city was awash with violence. It was not clear to many why exactly they were hurling rocks at police lines or firing rubber bullets over poverty-riddled crowds, as the attention and goal of the crowd was volatile at best. Electric gates had been set up in town squares, with riot pens filled beyond capacity to the point there were riots within the riot pens themselves. Attempts at deploying aerial drones to fire chemicals into the crowd only served to arm them further as rocks, cans and even makeshift cannons made from overcharged B-D tennis ball launchers were used to shoot them out of the sky, those same chemicals being thrown back at the police lines just minutes later. By the late hours, a formal request for use of high-frequency speakers and mass chemical dispersal had been made, but dismissed by the PM personally.\n\nIt was only when the chaos had started to die down that an understanding of the riot's main ideology was ascertained. By the end of the day, the famous statues of Boulton, Watt and Murdoch, founding figures of the industrial revolution, had been…"

england_event.2.d:0 "Violence erupted today on the streets of Birmingham following a slow collapse of central authority by the English Government. After the Great Mistake, England's economy and status as a European power was quick to decline, and in recent years, the nation has become reliant on the North Sea Alliance both politically and economically for stability.\n\nFollowing the eruption of a large riot in the streets of the capital city several months ago, the building tension across the nation has divided the people across several ideological lines. In the east, advocates of the 21st century 'English Spring' plan seek to rebuild the nation under strong ecological ideals in line with INTEGR. In the Home Counties, frustration with the technological shock of NSA integration has brought rise to a paramilitary of anti-technological militia under ex-general Nigel John-Hall, and in the south, a small force of breakaway militia under MP Arthur Burr hold the regions of Kent and Cornwall.\n\nTime will tell if the old government can withstand the storm, or if England will be swept away under a tide of long-boiling discontent."
