  scavenging:0 "§RScavenging§!"
  scavenging_desc:0 "Our great state has fallen far since the Golden Ages, and is now forced to rely on scavenging and international goodwill to compete with its local rivals. Although this style of economic development is quite basic and will become unavailable once we advance to a certain point, for now we must make do with what we have. Scavenger teams are sent out daily and their results are aggregated in the §YScavenger Points§!, which represents accumulated equipment and human power. As long as we maintain such a basic standard of living, we might as well invest whatever scraps we have into upgrading existing scavengers, thereby increasing the §YMonthly Scavenger Rate§!. However, due to the complex relationships and investments needed to subsidize the scavengers, lowering these efforts is too impractical to consider. Unfortunately, should we be dragged into a war, additional scavenger teams will be rerouted to the front.\n\n Throughout the following years, we can convert what we have scavenged into §YRaw Equipment§! and §YManpower§!, or use some of the loot to immediately hire local §YWarbands§! and §YMercenaries§!. It is also possible to utilize the few credit lines and international aid offers available to us to further the scavenging efforts at the expense of industrial revival through §YAusterity Programs§! and limited raids on neighboring nations. Beware that there isn't an infinite supply of hidden caches in the country, as the §YAreas Left Unsearched§! functions have a hard limit on how much our scavengers can ever discover."

  scav.1.d:0 "We can invoke existing credit lines to purchase equipment from other countries or on the black market. Our credibility depends on our current level of factory development, and more factories will allow us to take out bigger loans. Failure to repay our benefactors is not a viable option and we will have to foreclose on certain assets to do so. Needless to say the austerity measures that will make this possible will also damage our economy for about a month."
