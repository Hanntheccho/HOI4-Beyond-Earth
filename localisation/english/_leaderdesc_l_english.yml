 #POLITICS_YANKOV_DANILOVICH_DESC:0 "Yankov Danilovich was never a fan of the University. No amount of propaganda for the "greater good" could convince him that the skeletons in the State's closet were worth it. Yankov attended Moscow University during the warlord period, during which time he was credited with defending the building from bandits. This action led Yankov to being conscripted during the Belorussian Insurrection, where he participated in a BioWeapons unit. Witnessing the horrors of modern warfare firsthand, Yankov began identifying as a pacifist. By the war's conclusion, his inventions netted over 2,000 combat kills, which he denounced as "my evil inventions".\n\nAfter the war, Yankov returned to Moscow University, only to find readmission locked behind a high fee. It was only through the Prokhor's notice of Yankov's abilities was he able to return to his studies. Once the University began to encompass all scientific institutions in the Federation, Yankov had gained enough support among its students so as to form the "Reformist" wing, arguing for strict ethical limits on research, but also started a failed petition to isolate the University from military activities. Now, Yankov Danilovich finds himself at Eurasia's helm, and he vows to never repeat the atrocities of war."
 #POLITICS_STRELKOV_DMITRIEVICH_DESC:0 "A child of the Dark Ages, Strelkov was the diamond in the coal. During the warlord times, Eurasia's armies consisted of untrained conscripts, rushed to the front in a desperate attempt to maintain control over the Core Cities. All trained soldiers, veterans of the Central Asian Campaign, fought under warlords. Strelkov was one of the few officers who always stood by Eurasia, and has been credited with destroying over two dozen warlord bands.\n\nNow, Strelkov leads a loose coalition of army units who look to the past for guidance. The Slavic Federation, in their opinion, is a symbol of weakness, its members plagued by decadence. Strelkov, alongside notable commanders like The Titan, have been too powerful for previous governments to quell, and now that Strelkov's clique has taken control over Eurasia, the rest of the world quakes in fear. Russia is back, and Europe is in the crosshairs."
 #POLITICS_THE_TITAN_DESC:0 "Titan remembers a tale that humanity forgot, the sole benefit of being more than two centuries old. Hooked up to a building's worth of machinery and wires, Titan has been kept alive through cold technology. All that is left of the original man, once a legendary general of days that now exist only in legend, is a frail corpse and a sickened brain. Titan has experienced everything the world had to offer and, with the help of modern technology, reached into a world completely different. He has felt what it is like to be all-knowing, and isolated himself in truth. Divorced from the world, Titan sealed himself within the Datalinks for what seemed like an eternity.\n\nBut then it was all lost. For he has eaten from the Tree of Life, and will never taste the fruit again. All that was known became lost, all that was uncovered became forever sealed. Carried on wings of ultimate authority, Titan rushed towards a fleeting feeling, a dream unheard, a sight unseen. Now, with a crippled mind and an unreachable past, Titan has one last plan, a forlorn hope, an idea that may have once been repulsive but is now necessary. The modern Titan is unrecognizable, but he cares not. Within the fleshy, steel shell of his mind, he is waging a titanic struggle on the world and will never stop."
 #POLITICS_YUG_COMMAND_DESC:0 "The remnants of Army Group South have no real leader. A variety of petty generals, warlords, and raiders preside over their tiny domains. The strongest of this force is Yug Army Command, surviving in the Ural Mountain range. Comprised of aging officers and disgruntled veterans, Command nonetheless wields the largest organized force in the region. It also maintains a direct communications line with Moscow, and is nominally allowed to patrol the Urals."
 #POLITICS_PROKHOR_ZAKHAROV_DESC:0 "Prokhor Zakharov was born in the city of Cherskiy, Russia, during the Dark Ages. His father was a businessman and politician, but early exposure to the corruption of post-Mistake society led the young Zakharov to reject such a "worldly" career. Instead, he pursued an education in the sciences, earning his first degree from the University of Moscow at the age of 18 (largely through Interlink correspondence courses). He then joined the Russian Defense Force, where he exhibited an exceptional aptitude for physics and engineering, sent to the University of Moscow on-site for Masters in engineering. During the warlord period, the Russian Far East was the site of civil unrest and border skirmishes with the Chinese refugees. Zakharov served as a combat engineer in these conflicts, earning a reputation for radical innovation under stressful conditions.\n\nCognitive ability exceedingly high; genius level. Worldview driven almost exclusively through logic. Poor ethical judgment and inability to weigh in emotional factors; moderate deficiency in social functioning. Puts strong reliance on tools and his ability to use and adapt them; this, over human values, represents ultimate good. Ability to work as part of a team towards definable goals invaluable to mission, but poorly defined sense of ethics and tendency toward self-aggrandizement must be closely monitored by ranking superior."
 #POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DUPONT_DESC:0 "François Dupont served in the military police at the end of the Dark Days, only to be promoted to general after the mass departure of veterans. He never participated directly in a war, but his work within the friendly lines earned him a reputation as an iron fist, especially with immigrants, political prisoners and his own comrades. He always maintained a nationalist discourse in favour of the Union, accompanied by a ridiculously centralised and unified vision of it. Anyone who held an opinion contrary to his own became ungrateful to him.\n\nHe trained at the military academy in Paris, and was active in the then Parti Unioniste Conservador, which was based in the same city. The party was dissolved after his promotion and he joined the Partido Nationale. Although he did not consider himself a supporter of Élodie, he always supported the new party and his country with pride.\n\nWhile his own friends describe him as a steadfast and consistent person, what stands out most about Dupont is his high motive for power, his hidden ambition, his wet dream to reform the Federation into a strong state capable of standing up to its enemies and to itself. One that can maintain its personality and not allow others to destroy its culture, whatever the cost. His pride in Franco-Iberia is unparalleled, and he would do anything in his power to keep it alive. For Dupont, what his country stands for is not just Westernism, but purity, character, strength and brotherhood among its members, and freedom for those who accept it as such."
 #POLITICS_EVA_ROSENFELD_DESC:0 "For untold millennia, humanity has lived in harmony with the environment around it, taking what is necessary and giving back what it can.\n\nTo Eva Rosenfeld, life is complicated but doesn't need to be as complicated as it is. She initially studied to be a Historian, absorbing recounts of events long since passed, eventually climbing to be a Professor of History at the University of Leipzig. Everything from prehistory, to the birth of civilisation in Mesopotamia, and the middle ages became her drive, even studying what has been affectionately titled "The Golden Days" of humanity which brought forth immense technological growth as well as its most insufferable, ecological hubris. Years of studying humanity in its most natural state contrasted with the dying artificial state it has now suspended itself in, then broke the hopeful scholar.\n\nDrowning in grief, she began writing her Magnum Opus, the culmination of her new worldview, "The Rights of the Earth". The book was panned by the academic community for being unscientific and more of a manifesto but became a massive hit after INTEGR publicly endorsed it, parading it as a masterpiece of progressive thought.\n\nNow an official affiliate with INTEGR, Prof. Rosenfeld thus champions an agrarian and simplistic lifestyle, free from the crooked nature of industrial life, a life in touch with the spirit of the land and its creatures. Although many question her state of mind, it is without doubt her thoughts have strung a chord with the people."
 #POLITICS_EUGEN_LANGER_DESC:0 "Of the INTEGR faction, few are as calculated and collected as the elusive Eugen Langer. A certified genius and researcher from the Berlin Research Institute, Eugen prefers to observe the world through a very specific wavelength.\n\nInitially beginning as a chemistry student, Langer's academic life exploded into numerous fields of research, eventually collecting himself 5 PhDs, and publishing more than 30 papers in fields such as Particle Physics, Organic Chemistry and Bioengineering. Renowned for his intellect and feared for his cold attitude towards others, he made few friends during this period of his life, instead sticking close to immediate family.\n\nSadly however, a brutal blow would be dealt to this stability. Langer watched as his father, his most cherished friend and only remaining parent, died painfully from a treatable infection of the lungs. Discovering that budget cuts had been made to the health department for the sake of increased welfare payments, his formally stoic and logical mind was brought to anger and frustration.\n\nTo Langer, the "free" democratic system was revealed to be a paper-thin façade for the ineptocratic mess that was led by a weak and imprudent mass mentality, incapable of leading humanity into the future. INTEGR was therefore the best alternative, a group of alternate-thinking individuals who see that a shift in gear is necessary to prepare for the future. Joining at the first opportunity, his systematic diligence and hard work paid off, forming his own Sophistocratic faction, idolising a scholar-led society. While Langer is certainly no politician, his branch of INTEGR is understandably the most feared for having a true genius at the helm."
