international_news_event.1.d:0 "As part of the ISS Unity project, countries from all over the world have participated in the finalization of the Bridge. Due to the difficulty in ascending spaceship parts into orbit, the Bridge was constructed almost entirely in space, then attached to the Unity skeleton. According to one Professor Matthews, the hardest part about making a vessel capable of traveling between the stars is the AI.\n\n"Every calculation has to be precise, but when you're involved with so many variables, it's so overwhelming for a human." Matthews explained in a recent interview, "With the AI, we have to strike a balance between it being smart enough to do all the heavy lifting for us, but also constrained enough so as not to... you know." Indeed, fears of an AI malfunction have been high ever since the passing of Professor Song in 2192, one of the pioneers behind the Unity Project and a proponent of Positronic Brains. The current spaceship AI, affectionally named "Parrot" by the orbital crews, is programmed to handle navigation, drone control, and strategic planning. "No, I don't think there'll be any problems with Parrot," Matthews announced in another interview, "heh, we humans aren't out of the game just yet!""

international_news_event.2.d:0 "Earlier today, a test run of crew quarters on board the ISS Unity has confirmed them to be entirely functional, thanks to the work of the scientists from [FROM.GetNameDef]. The quarters include four separate levels. The top level is reserved for officers and the captain, complete with office space and a recreational room. The compartments here are significantly wider that those below, so as to facilitate a more relaxed lifestyle. The next level is for ship functionaries, the ship mess hall, and the general entertainment room. An administrative and logistics office is also present on this level, as are labs and a mechanic's room.\n\nThe third level is reserved for semi-hibernating passengers, who are to be awoken every other Earth month, or on demand, for specialized tasks such as complex medical services, agricultural maintenance, and live morale support. The last level is comprised of stasis chambers and can hold up to four thousand individuals. This area also includes medical stations, an inspector's office, and crew storage compartments. The criteria for selection varies from country to country, but it is generally accepted that one has to be exceptionally skilled and renowned to be given a space on the ship. The crew quarters, with the sole exception of the top level, is overseen by a separate AI that monitors physical and mental health levels. Currently the ISS Unity is staffed by a workers' crew of roughly six hundred, but most terrestrial powers have rockets on standby to rapidly populate and launch the spaceship in case of an emergency."

Like the quarters, the life support systems exist on multiple levels. The top layers are reserved for hydroponics and husbandry, watched over by a team of agricultural experts and a complex AI. The lower levels include filtration and recycling facilities, additional medical bays, and generators. The ISS Unity gets its energy from an array of solar panels that cover its sides. Carbon Dioxide Removal systems are present on the lower levels as well, flanked by air quality control and water management facilities.\n\nAs per Unity Project rules, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been given permission to install safeguards in the Life Support AI matrixes and around the ship's skeleton in general. The uplink controlling these safeguards has been placed in [FROM.Capital.GetName] and reinforced inside a bunker. As wars continue to flare up around the world, many analysts are wondering whether some day these bunkers will be stormed by ravaging armies, eager to get off the increasingly uninhabitable Earth."

Now, under the guidance of [FROM.GetNameDef] engineers, these answers have been made a reality with the Unity's storage systems being assembled.\n\nSpecially-designed prefabs, vehicles and tools have all been carefully stowed in preparation for planetfall, along with ample stockpiles of spare parts and raw materials. The world's surviving species have been catalogued and sampled as comprehensively as deteriorating conditions allow, with a vast genetic library installed aboard the Unity for colonists to call upon. So too has a sizeable database of Earth culture - nicknamed "the Canon" by some involved in the project - been compiled in the hopes that colonists will never forget Earth even if they never return to it.\n\nWhile the essential supplies, samples and data are already onboard, an ongoing upload of less-essential cultural data is being conducted from an uplink in [FROM.Capital.GetName]. This includes historical data intended to cover world events right up until the Unity's departure, which is increasingly dominated by news of growing environmental decline, armed conflict, and general desperation. As bleak a picture as it paints, the technicians maintaining the upload express hope that it will help future generations of colonists understand the gravity of the Unity's mission long after its departure from Earth."

Even disregarding its importance in potentially preserving the human species, it is an incredibly complex vessel utilizing cutting edge technology in every aspect of its operation. And nowhere is this more apparent than in its newly-constructed engine. \n\nDesigned by an international committee of scientists and engineers hosted by [FROM.GetNameDef], the engine utilizes the latest advancements in fusion technology to generate thrust. This will not only apply to the Unity's departure, but also its arrival - the engine will need to decelerate the Unity as it nears its destination, reducing its speed sufficiently to allow careful manoeuvring into a planetary orbit. Failure could see the Unity overshoot its target, easily dooming the mission as the vessel is lost to deep space. It could also result in the Unity colliding with an interstellar object, or simply never reaching its destination in the first place. \n\nFuelling the engine has proven similarly challenging. In addition to fuel refined specifically for the Unity mission, the vessel will use a first-of-its-kind ramscoop to harvest hydrogen from the vacuum of space. Though very limited in effectiveness due to the prohibitively large magnetic field needed to harvest ample fuel, the ramscoop will nonetheless provide a trickle of fuel that could prove crucial should initial reserves be depleted. [FROM.GetNameDef] is conducting ongoing testing and simulations from the engine's uplink facility in [FROM.Capital.GetName], hoping to optimize the ramscoop's effectiveness and the engine's overall fuel consumption. The entire mission may yet depend on it."

Then, one day, something changed. It was not an immediate change, but the gradual product of eons. This species made fire and after that came agriculture, urbanization, tools and history. Many members of this people wrote long epics about the sadness of their condition. They spoke of a general disunity that pervaded the species, a shameless feeling that caused that caused it to be in a state of constant war against itself.\n\nThis culminated when the species grew too powerful, so powerful, that its wisdom could not catch up. It found itself on an unstoppable treadmill, running from something, but somehow stuck in one place. But now that species, which began in caves, stands on the cusp of a golden age. For better or worse, the age-old belief in division has been temporarily disproven. The peoples of that planet stand together now, in the face of entropy, and look up to the stars. Their home is dying, and they know that most will not make it. But for a rare moment, there is a general sense of acceptance. The last light of this species will soon depart for a distant planet, perhaps never to return home. Or maybe, in some unforeseeable future, the warped skies of the Motherworld will open to reveal the homecoming of a child long thought dead.

Human civilization, on the backfoot for centuries, now chops off slices of itself until only one side remains. Future historians, if there will be any left, shall look back to this time either with pride or disappointment. The time of learning from history is over, for nothing will stand between humanity and its survival. The first to colonize other planets will have every justification and absolution possible. Everybody else will be left at their mercy. Across the world, doors long through shut are opening, and prayers rise in vain to the stars. This is a time of legends, a time of unparalleled devastation, this is..."
