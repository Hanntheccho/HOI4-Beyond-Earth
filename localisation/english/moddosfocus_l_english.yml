 DOS_to_the_coast_desc:0 "District 2 has been fighting the subversive Chrysalids for some time now. As the last remnants of pre-war warlords, the enigmatic Silk Path has continued to be a thorn in the side of both Central and ARC. District 2's officers are tasked with cleansing the District of the subversives… but may have other plans waiting in store."

 DOS_divided_leadership_desc:0 "This District is ruled by two organizations simultaneously.\n\nThe first is the ARC Delegation, led by Vice President Anthony Beaton of Reclamation Cascadia. Although far away from home, this clique has managed to secure a support base among the District's affluent citizenry. Due to its mountainous nature, old Cascadia has escaped the worst of the Great Mistake, which has allowed it to keep a sizable middle class, which is all too eager to support Beaton's promises of extended life.\n\nThe other faction, led by Relief Officer Haven Barnett, is the Central Delegation. While it draws popular backing from the poorer Southern parts, it has roots in the upper classes as well. Though less radical than her ARC counterpart, Barnett also seeks the elusive goal of extended life.\n\nFor now, the two factions are united in the struggle against the Western warlord. But as victory draws closer, the cracks deeper, and the whole structure can come crashing down..."

 #POLITICS_ANTHONY_BEATON_DESC:0 "Antony Beaton is the regional Vice President of ARC reclamation projects in Cascadia. Beaton began his career in 2182 as a clerk in Central government departments before moving to the East Coast in search of wider opportunities. His finances ran dry and he had to take refuge in an ARC encampment near New England. There Beaton partook in several skirmishes with raiders before being discharged from the city militias due to a festering leg wound. He would spend the next 3 years in a research hospital, where he was spared from "irreparable" status by undergoing a miraculous recovery.\n\nStill recovering, Anthony Beaton enlisted in the hospital staff and began a career as a research scientist. He proved his worth many times over by assisting hundreds of patients, which prompted the head doctor to recommend Beaton to his superiors in ARC itself. Beaton spent the following years studying medicine and showed an extreme interest in rejuvenation technology. He ascended the ranks at a lightning speed and was eventually assigned to lead an ARC expedition into District 2, in the hopes of flipping it to ARC's side. The Cascadian wilderness allowed Beaton to exercise his strong leadership and strategic skills. Now, Beaton has become somewhat enchanted by the enemy he is facing, the Silk Path. He makes vague promises of eternal life to his closest followers and not even ARC believes that he is a completely loyal asset anymore. However, Beaton has organized a large support base and is unlikely to stop his search."
 #POLITICS_HAVEN_BARNETT_DESC:0 "The daughter of a prominent Central statesman, Haven Barnett lived her entire life within the Rocky Mountains. Given everything and wasting nothing, she graduated as valedictorian of her class and won three pan-American gold medals for skiing. Propelled to high status almost immediately following college, she took over her late father's position, but at a cost. Her professional life soon eclipsed everything else, leaving her unmarried and childless at the age of 49. Barnett couldn't care less.\n\nIn 2193, Haven Barnett ascended to regional representative of Lesser Central. This bold move left her opponents in the dust, and a plot began. Too preoccupied with riots and keeping a popular image, Barnett was suddenly ousted from office under corruption charges. Fortunately, her money bought good lawyers and she managed to retain her position, albeit without the reputation that came with it. Fearing for her safety and realizing that another plot was brewing, Barnett accepted a reassignment to District 2 with the explicit goal of crushing the last pre-war warlord residing there, but with another, secret goal to isolate and defeat the ARC expedition there.\n\nAlthough she is no scientist, Haven Barnett has also realized the prize she may be sitting on: the District's scientists and facilities are all too suited for the search for immortality: the cure to aging."
