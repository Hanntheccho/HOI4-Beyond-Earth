 FRA_elodie_batteux_desc:0 "Long wealthy, Élodie's lineage traces back to the nobility and privileged elite of France and Italy a millennia before the Great Mistake. Her family's prestige and influence was not, however, based on its peerage, but rather on the immense fortune it had amassed over the previous two centuries from its holdings in agriculture, food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles.\n\nBorn in Europe's foremost fertility and maternity clinic in Braga, Élodie was her parents' only child. Raised in luxury along the Cote d'Azur and the Costa del Sol, Élodie became a media darling as a teen, although not always portrayed in a flattering light. Accused by her detractors as an isolationist, and a European elitist, Élodie certainly possessed a famously acerbic tongue and quick wit. A strong believer in the value of the Western cultural tradition, she believed that it was up to the educated European elite to guide the masses for their betterment, ensuring the survival of high culture.\n\nThe best way to do this on Earth was the independence and sustainability of the new Union."
 FRA_al_hakim:0 "Al-Hakim"
 FRA_al_hakim_desc:0 "Al-Hakim is one of the most important people in the French political region. Born to an Algerian immigrant family in the now-flooded suburb of Saint-Quen, North Paris and brought up in the crime-infested neighbourhoods of the city, he would initially become a part of this dark underworld, but government initiatives designed to raise the delinquent youth out of the world of crime, saw great promise in Al-Hakim.\n\nTurning his life around, he began reading up on economics, philosophy, history and more, eventually writing his first book at the age of 23. This would kickstart Al-Hakim's widely popular literary career, culminating in highly successful but widely criticised "Hakim Manifesto". The book was infamous for its lambasting of 21st century culture and lifestyles, declaring the Great Mistake was caused by a group he calls the "Fake People" whilst fellow "True People" were disadvantaged. The historian community rejected the book, but it's contents were exactly what the populus of Franco-Iberia wanted to hear.\n\nEncouraged by millions of supporters, Al-Hakim would go on to use his newly-acquired wealth to found a new political party, the Partido Populaire, becoming the 2nd most powerful political force in Franco-Iberia, and continuing to gain supporters.\n\nUltimately, Hakim strives for complete social equality and a political rework, seeking to prevent "Fake People" from ever again coming to power."
