 #Leader
  ITA_ottaviano_acquati:0 "Ottaviano Acquati"
  ITA_ottaviano_acquati_desc:0 "Ottaviano Acquati has seen his fair share of hardships throughout his life. His family originally came from the cities of the Po Valley that now lie underwater, fleeing to higher ground when the Italian government issued its emergency evacuations. He was thusly born relatively impoverished and often abandoned school to support his family.\n\nHis only saving grace was his innate skill with judicial law. Often reading university law textbooks in his free time, he would grow to become a talented representative in the court of law. Armed with the know-how to make waves in the legal and political world, and the empathy of the fellow environmental refugee, Acquati joined the Partito Sociale, hoping to end the cycle of poverty and suffering that plagued his own upbringing.\n\nThere are but two problems, Franco-Iberia and Padania. The so-called "Liberator" of Europe who has shown nothing but contempt for the weakened nation-states of Europe and seeks to keep Italy split between the Peninsula and Padania. They are tyrants on a continental scale and Acquati will not sit by and watch as this injustice continues. He is Italy's greatest Lawmaker and has represented many cases in his time. Now, he has the task of protecting all of Italy from one of the most powerful nations in the world."

 #Ideas
  ITA_padania_moment:0 "Padanian Revanchism"
  ITA_rich_exodus:0 "Rich Exodus"
  ITA_partito_sociale:0 "Il Partito Sociale"
  ITA_padania_moment_desc:0 "During the Dark Days, the northern regions of Italy slowly became more economically and socially distant from the rest of the country. Wealth disparity and the identification of the North as too distinct from the remainder of the country became more common as the decades went by. Eventually, the flooding of the Po Valley solidified the boundary between North and Central Italy.\n\nMounting tensions led to an independence referendum, concluding with Padania becoming a separate sovereign entity apart from Italy, enticing various aristocrats and millionaires who sought to make Padania a haven for the elite and powerful, a 2nd Switzerland of old, where the rich from all over the world can indulge in luxury and ensure their financial security."
  ITA_rich_exodus_desc:0 "When Padania voted to leave Italy, many of the country's rich and powerful jumped ship and took all of their wealth to the young nation up north. Italy then was left with scraps, recoiling from the environmental refugee crisis, and now suffering a massive economic collapse as investments no longer flowed into the economy. It can now be barely considered a formidable player in economical terms, but with Partito Sociale, perhaps that will change."
  ITA_partito_sociale_desc:0 "With the division of the country on new international lines, the poor and desperate populus called upon a shining beacon to raise them out of the dirt. Partito Sociale is the glowing torch that has rescued so many from constant suffering, enacting new social policies and cracking down on exploitation.\n\nWith the peninsula firmly united under the Red Star, the party has pointed blame squarely on the insufferable capitalists in the north, the traitors who have abandoned their nation for wealth."

 #Events
  italy_event.1.t: "Denouncing Corrupted Traitors"
  italy_event.1.d: "Our government has officially condemned Padania. It is an artificial state, run by corrupt crooks, bolstered by foreign money and corporations, with a reputation of a tax haven, and an economy built upon suffering of unrepresented workers and unchecked capitalism. It is an artificial state, a glorified neo-colonialist buffer, a puppet of international capital. Padania is an abomination, a stain on the face of Europe, that, simply, has no right to exist. It is important for us to remember what makes Padania our mortal enemy. And why do they remain as such as long as they exist."
  italy_event_option.1.a: "A disgusting parody of modern Europe"
  italy_event.2.t: "Wiping The Slate Clean"
  italy_event.2.d: "Padania has declared its independence approximately 200 years ago. Before that, it was Northern Italy, a region different from the Central and Southern parts of our country, still an integral part of it. During the Great Mistake and its fallout, corrupt kleptocrats have seized control and declared independence, selling themselves out for corporate money. For the longest time, Italy didn't have an ability to deal with this issue, among numerous crises, but now, we are ready. Our economy is prepared for war, the populace supports our decision completely, and our army will be ready to cross the border within hours. It's time to reunite Italy."
  italy_event_option.2.a: "What was wrong, we will set right"
