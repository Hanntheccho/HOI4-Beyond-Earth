 SIL_war_on_the_past_desc:0 "John Doe is waging a war on the past, and the past is winning. Once the greatest warlord of the American Anarchy in the Northwest, John Doe's Silk Path has been reduced to a rump state near the Seattle coast. Although the city itself is too broken to be of much importance, it has been designated as ground zero of the extermination of the ancient culture that has led the people of this continent to ruin. According to John Doe, there is sin in America's past, and the only way to escape it is by extending the human lifespan. Naturally there has been pushback against these radical measures, the most notable of which are the two delegations from Central and ARC. Until these intruders are dealt with, John Doe must contend with a petty territory on the periphery of the continent."

 SIL_the_immortality_theory_desc:0 "The Silk Path is searching for a dream unseen. The search for immortality, as old as Sumeria, as sought after as the darkest secrets of the world. The Silk Path rejects clinical immortality as a temporary solution to a far bigger problem: the sickness known as aging. So far, there have been minor advances in maintaining tissue and mind cohesion, thereby extending the average follower lifespan beyond the century. However, the treatment for extended life is extensive and restricted to John Doe's close circle."

 POLITICS_JOHN_DOE_DESC:0 "An enigma. A philosopher. A savior. A fleeting memory of the old world.\n\nThese are just some of the words used to describe John Doe, the most mysterious man in North America. His first appearance in official records was in 2148, when a Central probe team reported that he had amassed a small following in Oregon, mostly consisting of mercenaries. After a brief firefight between Central forces and bandits, John Doe was caught and imprisoned alongside other petty warlords. The guards noted that he was already an ancient man then, likely in his 80's. No fingerprints could be taken due to his prosthetic hands and the prison was abandoned before further studies could take place. John Doe left and slipped into obscurity.\n\nIt was not until 2161 that John Doe resurfaced, this time at the head of a small army of fanatics. His face had become obscured by an esoteric mask and few knew of his real identity. When Central initiated the Northern campaign in 2166, John Doe was one among many of the petty warlords who resisted their advance. But the years dragged on and petty settlements fell. Eventually, John Doe's realm, once stretching from the Pacific to the Rockies, was reduced to small hideouts near the coast.\n\nJohn Doe's followers are almost as elusive as the man himself, but a few captured initiatives have spoken of mystifying things: John Doe and his close circle of "Chrysalids", or local elites, are searching for the cure to aging. Myths speak of the man's true identity and one can only wonder what his ancient eyes have seen... and what lies behind that iron mask."
