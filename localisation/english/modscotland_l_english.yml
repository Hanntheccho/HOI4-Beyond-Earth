 SCO_sea_never_sleeps:0 "The Sea Never Sleeps"
 SCO_sea_never_sleeps_desc:0 "The mountains stand firm as the tides turn far below, rising and falling. This is how it's been since the dawn of time. However, now the sea comes in sweeping lives, towns, and entire cities out to sea, never to be seen again. Though other people cry and weep before they give in to the sea, we do not, and will not. As always we fight, for once, not with sword and rifle but with shovel and crane. Even now, we lead a war against the very sea itself, reclaiming from its depths what it has stolen. Massive pipes pump water away, as with steel and concrete we build vast walls to reclaim land and keep the sea out."
 SCO_the_arks_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the project's divine namesake, we have built great cities upon the sea that have taken so much. Each city is an ark, to preserve humanity, an industrial monument of economy and skill. Each one is a hub of human traffic, as everyone seeks a place on the arks. Demand outweighs supply as usual during a disaster."
 SCO_the_nsa_desc:0 "The North Sea Alliance is a great idea, one that could bear powerful fruit. For now it is an alliance crumbling from within as old rivalries resurface and delusions of grandeur seep into the politics. This is exemplified by the two most powerful members, Scotland and England. England shudders and wails in pain as it crumbles from within, vultures fighting over her heart. Scotland strives to make a new future separate from England, but fears the chaos of the South and English stubbornness. Though if these troubles can be overcome, it shall grow in strength as new member states join the pact, fulfilling its namesake as it claims dominion over the North Sea."

 scotland_formable:0 "The North Sea Alliance"
 scotland_formable_desc:0 "The NSA was a Scottish-initiated alliance that has maintained its initial organisational model since its inception. Before the former Netherlands disappeared from the maps, the alliance was used by many of the countries to coordinate gigantic engineering works to fight against the designs of nature.\n\nWhat was lost in the Netherlands may be irretrievable, but the North Sea Alliance has made incredible progress in terms of terrain modification and adaptation to the rising tide. Large cities, floating or not, pump water back into the sea with enormous efficiency, waves crash daily against the high walls erected to protect nations from nature.\n\nAll this has not prevented the Alliance from finding itself in a weak spot. Should the Alliance create a defensive force capable of defending its progress or should it continue with its historic approach?\n\n§LThe choice is yours...§!"

 #LEADER
 SCO_duncan_hughes:0 "Duncan Hughes"
 SCO_duncan_hughes_desc:0 "Born to a local shipping magnate in the Scottish port city of Aberdeen, Duncan Hughes was something of an enigma when he first appeared on the political circuit roughly a decade ago. Schooled at the Sturgeon Naval College and given an otherwise comfortable upbringing, biographers have long since attributed the quirks of Hughes' personality to his time spent as a teenager working at his father's docks. His father had insisted he work as an apprentice longshoreman to instill a strong work ethic, and yet, the experience seems to have jaded Hughes, as the other dockhands had little regard for "a soft-handed boy underfoot" and paid him only as much attention as required. Still, some might say his father was right - in the present day, Hughes is known as a remarkably tireless man with little fear of difficult confrontations.\n\nHughes is recognized as one of the first to publicly acknowledge the growing gap between the North Sea Alliance's potential versus other world powers. Named as head of the Priority Development Committee, Hughes can be credited with securing many of the trade deals and alliances that allowed for the relatively swift ramp-up to national production."
