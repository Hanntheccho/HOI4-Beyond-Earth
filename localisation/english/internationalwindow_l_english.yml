Ships sail out of their harbors, one last time, while swarms of drones and airplanes fly overhead. Unity crews sit alone in their pods, anxiously awaiting their fate. Governors sit behind closed doors, hoping for a reprieve from the madness outside. But the night comes and there is no escape from the Final War.

Due to the difficulty in ascending spaceship parts into orbit, the Bridge was constructed almost entirely in space, then attached to the Unity skeleton. According to one Professor Matthews, the hardest part about making a vessel capable of traveling between the stars is the AI.\n\n"Every calculation has to be precise, but when you're involved with so many variables, it's so overwhelming for a human." Matthews explained in a recent interview, "With the AI, we have to strike a balance between it being smart enough to do all the heavy lifting for us, but also constrained enough so as not to... you know." Indeed, fears of an AI malfunction have been high ever since the passing of Professor Song in 2192, one of the pioneers behind the Unity Project and a proponent of Positronic Brains. The current spaceship AI, affectionally named "Parrot" by the orbital crews, is programmed to handle navigation, drone control, and strategic planning. "No, I don't think there'll be any problems with Parrot," Matthews announced in another interview, "heh, we humans aren't out of the game just yet!""

The quarters include four separate levels. The top level is reserved for officers and the captain, complete with office space and a recreational room. The compartments here are significantly wider that those below, so as to facilitate a more relaxed lifestyle. The next level is for ship functionaries, the ship mess hall, and the general entertainment room. An administrative and logistics office is also present on this level, as are labs and a mechanic's room.\n\nThe third level is reserved for semi-hibernating passengers, who are to be awoken every other Earth month, or on demand, for specialized tasks such as complex medical services, agricultural maintenance, and live morale support. The last level is comprised of stasis chambers and can hold up to four thousand individuals. This area also includes medical stations, an inspector's office, and crew storage compartments. The criteria for selection varies from country to country, but it is generally accepted that one has to be exceptionally skilled and renowned to be given a space on the ship. The crew quarters, with the sole exception of the top level, is overseen by a separate AI that monitors physical and mental health levels. Currently the ISS Unity is staffed by a workers' crew of roughly six hundred, but most terrestrial powers have rockets on standby to rapidly populate and launch the spaceship in case of an emergency."

Like the quarters, the life support systems exist on multiple levels. The top layers are reserved for hydroponics and husbandry, watched over by a team of agricultural experts and a complex AI. The lower levels include filtration and recycling facilities, additional medical bays, and generators. The ISS Unity gets its energy from an array of solar panels that cover its sides. Carbon Dioxide Removal systems are present on the lower levels as well, flanked by air quality control and water management facilities.\n\nAs per Unity Project rules, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been given permission to install safeguards in the Life Support AI matrixes and around the ship's skeleton in general. The uplink controlling these safeguards has been placed in [FROM.Capital.GetName] and reinforced inside a bunker. As wars continue to flare up around the world, many analysts are wondering whether some day these bunkers will be stormed by ravaging armies, eager to get off the increasingly uninhabitable Earth."

Then, one day, something changed. It was not an immediate change, but the gradual product of eons. This species made fire and after that came agriculture, urbanization, tools and history. Many members of this people wrote long epics about the sadness of their condition. They spoke of a general disunity that pervaded the species, a shameless feeling that caused that caused it to be in a state of constant war against itself.\n\nThis culminated when the species grew too powerful, so powerful, that its wisdom could not catch up. It found itself on an unstoppable treadmill, running from something, but somehow stuck in one place. But now that species, which began in caves, stands on the cusp of a golden age. For better or worse, the age-old belief in division has been temporarily disproven. The peoples of that planet stand together now, in the face of entropy, and look up to the stars. Their home is dying, and they know that most will not make it. But for a rare moment, there is a general sense of acceptance. The last light of this species will soon depart for a distant planet, perhaps never to return home. Or maybe, in some unforeseeable future, the warped skies of the Motherworld will open to reveal the homecoming of a child long thought dead. Or maybe there will be nothing at all from the offspring of this species, and it will wither and die in silence."

Perhaps the terrestrial media underplayed the importance of the event. Perhaps the people were too busy with their own issues. There were a hundred potential reasons for the lackluster reception of the first inter-solar spaceship, but none of them really mattered. The workers coldly shook hands in front of cameras and flew back home.\n\nOn Earth, tensions continued to rise. Famines, wars, general destruction and decay had become the order of the day. Some said that there was another Great Mistake, be it literal or spiritual, happening. But the nations and alliances of the world knew better than to waste time on petty conflicts.
