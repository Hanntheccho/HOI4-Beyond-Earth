 CAS_haven_barnett_desc:0 "The daughter of a prominent Central statesman, Haven Barnett lived her entire life within the Rocky Mountains. Given everything and wasting nothing, she graduated as valedictorian of her class and won three pan-American gold medals for skiing. Propelled to high status almost immediately following college, she took over her late father's position, but at a cost. Her professional life soon eclipsed everything else, leaving her unmarried and childless at the age of 49. Barnett couldn't care less.\n\nIn 2193, Haven Barnett ascended to regional representative of Lesser Central. This bold move left her opponents in the dust, and a plot began. Too preoccupied with riots and keeping a popular image, Barnett was suddenly ousted from office under corruption charges. Fortunately, her money bought good lawyers and she managed to retain her position, albeit without the reputation that came with it. Fearing for her safety and realizing that another plot was brewing, Barnett accepted a reassignment to District 2 with the explicit goal of crushing the last pre-war warlord residing there, but with another, secret goal to isolate and defeat the ARC expedition there.\n\nAlthough she is no scientist, Haven Barnett has also realized the prize she may be sitting on: the District's scientists and facilities are all too suited for the search for immortality: the cure to aging."
