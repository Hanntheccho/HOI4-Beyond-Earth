 ONE_land_of_the_free_desc:0 "The provinces once known as "California" are fried. Just like its East Coast counterpart, the land is heavily flooded and has a bloody history of anarchy. The few who remain live their lives as raiders, pillaging long-abandoned homes and farms in a never-ending search for food. Scars from meltdowns and chemical warfare still plague the air."

 ONE_central_aid_high_desc:0 "This District is receiving supplies and developmental aid from Central. While these resources are but scraps off an already tiny plate, the survivors are ready to do anything to get some fresh meat or more ammo."

 ONE_survivor_cliques_desc:0 "District 1 has no governing body or civilization. There are no urban cities, American suburbs, or even sustainable farms. The biggest settlement is a small village of about five thousand near the coast, which trades with pirates for food. The rest of the District's inhabitants are forced to either hunt increasingly scarce prey, vegetation, or, in more extreme instances, each other. As the District is incapable of producing its own supplies, much less its own weapons, it relies on occasional Central shipments.\n\nThus, as time has passed, Central has tightened its grip on the District. All ammunition inflow is possible solely through Central's approval. This new power has therefore made many successful attempts at playing the local tribes against one another. The cliques are taking over one another, completely oblivious to their position on Central's chopping block. However, immediate reconstruction of social order in District 1 is impossible. The land is ruined by poisonous gases released by warlords over the decades. Irradiated ruins still dot the plains and hills. And the survivors keep fighting..."

 #ONE_central_administration_desc:0 "Some semblance of order has finally been brought to District 1. Central has set up a net of garrisoned settlements along the frontier, allowing for a much wider range of supplies to be delivered. The poor inhabitants of the District have already taken to praising their saviors and the survivor cliques of yesteryear are almost washed away. Civilization is returning to District 1. But under whose boot?"
