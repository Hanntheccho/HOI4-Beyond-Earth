 BHR_raj_thakur:0 "Raj Thakur"
 politics_thakur_desc:0 "Wisdom and meditation, though pillars of the soul, cannot sustain the weight of time. A revered and mystical figure, Raj Thakur's spiritual connections and ancient wisdom have brought him a loyal following in Bharat. But despite all his knowledge and experience, the inescapable claw of age is catching up to him. Long suffering from recurrent pancreatic cancer, Raj Thakur's mind has persevered despite his deteriorating body. The mere fact that he is still alive has been interpreted as a miracle by his more devoted followers. Now, however, his illness has surpassed even that which 22nd century science can cure, and his condition is terminal. India's voice of guidance has long since accepted his death, though perhaps the same cannot be said for his followers. Despite the decades of peace and meditation, the great fracture in Raj Thakur's serene mind is his dread for what might become of India after he is gone."

 politics_mandal_desc:0 "Raj Thakur, guiding voice of all India, left behind a powerful echo with his passing. Never before has a man been so beloved by his people, and never before has India wept, so. But time must go on, and a successor must be chosen – such is the cause of Radha Mandal. A proud follower of Thakur's wisdom ever since his childhood, Mandal spent his life in many positions. Beginning as a monk apprentice near Nepal in his formative years, Mandal eventually became disillusioned with a hermit's life and ventured into the cities, where he settled down and attended a university. First elected into local leadership at the age of 28, and then in provisional government positions, all the while still sternly practicing the beliefs of the then near divine Raj Thakur, Mandal befriended him after being elected mayor of New Lucknow. Mandal's position in government and his lifelong practice of Thakur's ideology allowed him to win a close election, barely stemming the potential tide of division that might otherwise have emerged following the old man's death.\n\nDespite being a devout Thakurist since his teenage years, his fellows, citizens, and even Mandal himself have doubts whether he can truly follow in the footsteps of such a great man. But for his master, friend and India's guiding hand, he is determined to unite the continent and bring about a cultural flourishing beyond anything that existed up to the Great Mistake."

 BHR_heart_of_india_desc:0 "Bharat is situated at the crossroads of most major Indian highways and lays claim to the industrial heartland of the North. Despite decades of setbacks and political scandals, the central government carries the most legitimate claim to the Indian Republic of old. Led by the aged politician and spiritual leader Raj Thakur, Bharat has barely managed to sustain a loose alliance of Indian warlords (albeit the alliance is more akin to an extensive non-aggression pact) who have long been fighting over our Old India. This temporary unity has netted Bharat an envious position as the crossroads of inter-warlord trade. Raj Thakur's extensive compound has also become home to influential individuals from all over the country and beyond, attracting foreign talent and much needed muscle."

 BHR_low_officer_clubs_influence_desc:0 "Although Raj Thakur carries an extraordinary amount of influence within Bharat, and the loyalty of his people has never been in question, the issue of military interests has always been a pressing matter. In Thakur's early days, back when Bharat was still an unstable warzone between army elements, raiders, and tides of refugees, the then-young and inexperienced leader elected to ally himself with the 4th Republican Army of India. The alliance helped him to cement power and ward off opportunistic invaders, but also allowed a rot of spirit to set in.\n\nIt was not until 2137 that the kettle boiled over: military elements led by one Krishna Aurora tried to march on the capital and force Thakur into the position of a puppet. The visionary was only saved by the timely arrival of his elite guards, who arrested Krishna and convinced the army to stand down. The following years were spent detoothing most of the military and making high command completely subordinate to Thakur's civilian administration. The only autonomous part of the army now is the Officers' Club, where ambitious generals and aging commanders plot to usher in a return of their once powerful force."

 bharat_event.1.t:0 "Equipment Drives"
 bharat_event.1.d:0 "The remilitarization of India is somewhat of a redundant phrase - India has, for as long as anyone can remember, been a battleground between roving tribes and warlords, only accented by the occasional prosperous settlement. However, actual heavy industry, the type generally considered necessary for the creation of expensive military hardware, is hard to come by. Most warlords acquire their guns by scavenging or make them in makeshift factories, but Bharat is one of the few states capable of sustaining a healthy industry. This can be exploited by nationalizing arms producers, seizing manufactories from petty warlords scattered all over the countryside, and enacting a new propaganda campaign that aims to promote austerity and community service."

 bharat_event.2.t:0 "Industrial Drives"
 bharat_event.2.d:0 "Much of India's wealth has historically been directed towards immediate militarization efforts. Enterprising individuals with enough capital to invest into public works have almost always elected to instead pursue arms sales due to their lucrative returns. While this practice has helped Bharat raise a large standing army with an actual modern supply chain, it has also hampered long-term growth. We can try to rectify this situation by handing out generous grants to industrial contractors and slashing taxes on long-term capital assets. Inactive military units may also volunteer through a newly chartered 'Office of Army Utilization' to help build roads and reinforce outdated forts within the interior. Our position at the crossroads of India can also allow us to increase tariffs on merchants belonging to hostile warlords or to seize their assets outright."

 bharat_event.3.t:0 "Lucknow Reconstruction"
 bharat_event.3.d:0 "The city of Lucknow, former administrative capital of the Uttar Pradesh region and once one of the most populated cities in India, has felt the brunt of the Dark Ages. Originally a target for a Pakistani nuclear barrage during the Great Mistake, the city's missile defense system managed to intercept the attacks. However, shortly after the brief but deadly conflict, a rumor began to circulate that the city had been wiped out entirely, and that the nearby 1st Armored Division was annihilated by radiation but that its valuable equipment was left mostly intact. Naturally, this painted a giant target on the area for warlords, who by this point had capitalized on the deteriorating social and economic situation on the subcontinent to carve out their own petty states. The warlord Mishri Seth, famed for his legendary takeover of the Lions Brigade in 2097, led a spearhead of bandits and dissatisfied soldiers into the city. The local population was forced out when the 1st Armored Division, which had survived the war, returned and set up a formidable defense. Lucknow would experience some of the worst fighting during the Dark Ages, and it was not until Seth's death in 2144 (killed during a mutiny by his own troops over low rations) that the city's corpse was returned to the government. The general poverty of Dark Age India meant that few resources could be spared for Lucknow's reconstruction, which left the city mostly a ruin... until now. Recently, Raj Thakur's most trusted advisors have pledged much of their personal wealth towards aiding the repopulation and reconstruction of the area. Although the city is still too devastated by iron harvests to return to pre-war glory, it can serve as the site of new tractor plants and refugee resettlement centers."

 bharat_event.4.t:0 "Fortress Revitalization"
 bharat_event.4.d:0 "During the Dark Ages, most cities had erected primitive defenses against roving marauders and rogue battalions. These included street palisades that funneled invaders into kill zones, automatic cannons on skyscrapers, mined countrysides, strategic reserve offices, and peoples' armories in every major district. As time went on and the situation in Bharat stabilized, however, the maintenance of these defenses became too much to bear and they were deactivated. Now, there are still many bunkers and ancient weapons left lying around. The maps pinpointing their locations have been lost to time, but with the help of artificial intelligence and new Network Nodes, we can begin to reactivate these security checkpoints and man them with militias and disabled volunteers from the fronts."

 bharat_event.14.t:0 "Raj Thakur Collapses"
 bharat_event.14.d:0 "Tragedy has been narrowly averted yesterday as the venerable Raj Thakur collapsed while in the middle of an online speech with municipal representatives. Thakur began the day as normal, spending three hours in the meditation chamber before attending regular medical treatment at the Capsule. He then retired to his study, from where he contacted the Officers' Club on important matters regarding intensifying raids by highwaymen. Officer Patel remarked that Thakur seemed a bit slower during the meeting and was visibly distracted by something off-camera. The following hour was spent at lunch, where a delegation of mountain hermits reported no obvious sign of illness on Thakur. At around four, Thakur lectured a group of economics students from the New University of Ghandi. The online technical assistant claimed that the old man was lively and in high spirits, a stark contrast to his condition just three hours later.\n\nThe day was to end with a meeting between Thakur and representatives from the municipalities and other warlords. The meeting had been planned for several days now and was supposed to conclude a groundbreaking trade treaty between Bharat and Odisha when suddenly Thakur fell over in his chair. Due to the leader's fierce belief in spiritual healing, his home lacked a resident doctor and it was not until twenty minutes had passed that an ambulance was dispatched. Thakur was found nearly dead in his study and immediately rushed to Sridhar Hospital. The government was left to Radha Mandal, who had returned from a meeting in West Bengal as soon as he had heard of the incident. The Officers' Club also dispatched a group of soldiers to supplement Thakur's own bodyguard, claiming that the sudden illness was the product of a failed assassination attempt. A brawl soon broke out between the two groups of guards, only to be interrupted by Thakur's incredibly short recovery. According to the nurse who was attending him, Thakur suddenly opened his eyes while in the middle of a coma and sat up straight. The leader is now recovering, but his brush with death serves as a grim foreshadowing of what may happen once the burden of time becomes too much for him."

 bharat_event.15.t:0 "The Orchicha Destruction"
 bharat_event.15.d:0 "Tragedy! The nuclear plant in Orchicha has suffered a meltdown in the early hours of the morning! Reports are still scarce, but the Ministry of the Interior has called in guards and claims that the meltdown has already claimed over two thousand lives. The plant, a relic of the Golden Ages, had never completely ceased operating once in its one hundred and thirteen year long lifespan.\n\nThe high demand for energy, only further increased in the Dark Days, prevented restructuring or proper maintenance from happening. According to some scientists, the meltdown was an inevitability, a product of poor upkeep and wearing a plant down until it could no longer function properly. But for the people near Orchicha, a sparsely populated pre-Mistake city that had survived an indirect nuclear strike during the Great Mistake, the reality of situation is much more dramatic. Deaths are expected to skyrocket in the following months despite government efforts and nearby hydroelectric plants will need to be strained even further to make up for the loss of energy generation. This, combined with Raj Thakur's near death experience just two months prior, has been interpreted as an ill omen by some spiritual leaders and administrators."
 bharat_event.15.a:0 "..."
 bharat_event.16.t:0 "Raj Thakur Falls Ill!"
 bharat_event.16.d:0 "The century keeps getting worse as Raj Thakur experienced another seizure two days ago. The old leader, now on minimal life support and accompanied by doctors, was attending an in-person opening ceremony for city gardens when he suddenly fainted in the middle of a speech by a Nepalese diplomat. Thakur was immediately carried over to a nearby arboreal bench, where he briefly regained consciousness and asked for somebody named Aditi before falling into a coughing fit. The doctors administered some medicine with the help of a nearby surgery bot, but in the end the help proved insufficient and arrangements were made to return to Sridhar Hospital. There, the esteemed Doctor Patel, renowned in India and beyond for work on limb replacements, suggested a transplant of the pancreas. Raj Thakur, barely able to speak, protested. It is a well known fact that the old leader has a distrust of modern technology and fears augmentation for corrupting the inner spirit. The hospital staff had to perform an old-school operation, and were nearly interrupted by a squad of Officer Club troops bursting into the hospital and demanding to see Thakur. Their rude intrusion was then followed by the arrival of Kavitha Thakur, Raj Thakur's daughter and current overseer of the Kavithan Protectorate to the Northwest. The two newcomers soon entered into a heated argument over Bharat's succession in the case of the old leader's death. The commotion was finally availed when Thakur recovered and summoned Mandal and Kavitha to his room. The ensuing conversation has been kept off-record, but the officers and officials believe that it concerned the issue of succession. Being Raj Thakur's daughter, Kavitha has also earned herself a reputation for being a dependable and just ruler during her reign over her small protectorate. However, Mandal wields a larger presence in Bharat and giving the country over to a family member may be seen as inherently anti-democratic by the government. Whatever the case, Raj Thakur's recovery must be hailed as yet another miracle."

In the end his pancreatic cancer was too much and his body was discovered by medical workers at eleven in the morning. Old enough to have experienced the post-Mistake calamity but also young enough to have left a permanent footprint in India's history during the Dark Ages, Raj Thakur will forever be remembered for working tirelessly and sacrificing much of his mental and physical wellbeing in the name of a united India.\n\nHowever, our worst fears are coming to pass, as the situation is already deteriorating. If Raj Thakur was holding the entirety of India together with sheer optimism and legacy, then without him we have nothing else to fall back on. Already, peripheral warlords have broken contact with Bharat and major factions are silently evacuating diplomats. Troop movement is visible on all borders except with the Kavithan Protectorate, whose leader, Raj's daughter Kavitha Thakur, is expected to make a political move before any military action takes place. The Officer Clubs have remained surprisingly silent on the death, a worrying sign indeed. Meanwhile, Radha Mandal has, as expected, ascended to the rank of leader and has been approved by parliament. The young follower of the late Raj Thakur promises to continue many of the old leader's policies and to seek a diplomatic solution within India."

Border authorities have managed to negotiate a tense truce with the warlords to the South, although how long this is expected to last is anybody's guess.

The other warlords have already summoned their armies, and we need only await some time out of respect for the late Raj Thakur before embarking on a righteous crusade to liberate the rest of the subcontinent. The upcoming war will demand all of our energy, resources, and willpower - but we will prevail, we will drive out the false pretenders, and we will bring about order and peace to India! Our primary objectives right now should be to evict soldiers currently stationed outside our controlled regions, reinforce the borders, militarize the industry and prepare for an onslaught.

The fledgeling Indian factions are now expected to fight over Old India in an unparalleled conflict. Volunteers from Africa and Europe have already boarded planes to help the warlords they align the most with politically, and mercenary groups are swelling by the hundreds.\n\nFor the leaders of the Indian states, the upcoming conflict will serve as a convenient path towards unification, but for the people, there is little to look forward to."

Born and raised in the impoverished fields of Punjab, his first time leaving the region was during a military raid when he was seventeen; the same raid where his father was killed.

Not quickly enough. ”Are you trying to annoy me, Sepoy?”\n\nThe boy strained to keep his composure as he processed the sentence. 'Sepoy' no longer meant the rank of a standard soldier. It was a sign of demotion. Dismissal from any valued position Reduced to a practical slave in all but name. His only chance at a meaningful life was over, and yet- “No, sir!”. He had to keep himself together, lest he not leave the room with a life at all. “Pack.” Was all Singh said before moving to the next bunk. The one order no soldier of Punjab ever wanted to hear.

Above all things, order, inspired by the great leaders of the past, her will is to be law.\n\nThe Youngest, most emotional and brash, has developed an understanding of humanity different from that of her fellow sisters.

Puffing out his chest and deepening his voice, he spoke as if he were his father.\n\n“My People. My Friends, I have come before you today for a proud proclamation and, if I may say, an ambitious idea. Our little Odisha has been wracked with poverty and lawlessness. Our brave soldiers have tried tirelessly to return some normalcy to our slice of India but to no avail. I therefore propose that the once awe-inspiring Keonjhar Mining Supercomplex be fully refurbished and restarted. No longer will you squat amongst the rotten muck of long-forgotten times, for you will have jobs. With its productive capacity, we will finally have the means of restoring order to India. Lend me your hands, for with them tightened, we may finally end this long embarrassment of ours!”\n\nBrajinath Das raised his arms in wondrous appreciation of the sky above, his generals emotionally applauded, his soldiers deeply chanting as one rabid beast.

The people, however, had marched for the treasures and facilities that lay tightly within. The soldiers then stopped to bark at the workers.\n\n“Your task is to aid in reconstruction of the industrial sector here. You all have assigned supervisors and sections as well as the tools required. We have orders from up top to clear out any scavengers or bandits, not to be your bodyguards. Looting of any kind will have you shot. Of course, you will be paid for your work.”\n\nThis first day would become a common routine.

It truly was a marvel of Indian engineering in its day if the datalink archives are to be trusted. But what Gatam saw as he entered the central hub couldn't be further from idyllic.\n\nWith the strength of all 5 squad members, the hinges finally crumbled under the crowbar's head, bringing the door down to the floor with a tremendous crash. Although dust clouded the entryway to what was once the foundry, a dashing shadow followed by malicious scraping and scampering from within left the entire team shuddering. The entire production floor was pitch black excluding the dull tint from the odd window. Gatam drew his ancient revolver, the only weapon he was allotted, and breathlessly inched forwards. Sitting several metres ahead and hunched over like some huge diseased rat, a ghastly human figure was groaning over a corpse.

All that remained was Das's ceremonial re-opening of the facility.\n\nAll the labourers who worked to clear or repair the project stood in strict line-and-file. Most were thin from hunger or gaunt in their face and limbs. Somewhere in the back of the several thousand worker formation, a woman fell to the floor and had to be dragged away by two soldiers. Although this went unnoticed by Das and his generals.\n\n“I would like to take this time to thank all of you brave souls.

India will be cleansed of radioactive blight and with the work you've done here as an example, even the Great Mistake itself may be reversed. So let me officially open the Keonjhar Mining Supercomplex!”\n\nIn the distance, the smokestacks sputtered to life.

Particularly, figures of authority.\n\nThey began as simple good samaritans. Those who believed the crisis would pass, and that the best could be made of their situation. Organizing food distribution, protecting the weak, and punishing the worst criminals. But soon, as with every authority, good intent alone cannot secure a regime. Food rations dwindled, the loss of life and seeming inaction beyond the Dam drained away what little hope these local civilian authorities could give the people. Soon, harsher punishments were handed out. Food rations were cut. Preference was given to 'loyalists', with the definition of such a thing varying wildly and hypocritically.\n\nSoon, the established authorities became a point of resentment, seen as an extension to the enigmatic eyes that guarded the Dam. Desertion, inner conflict and even brief, small scale civil wars saw the end of the well-meaning phase of authority in West Bengal. In their place, gangs and thugs became the new authority. Extortion and 'protection' rackets became the new taxes. Gang member 'payment' became the new distribution of food.

Small scale raids, theft, or even agreements made with amicable guards, typically in exchange for drugs. As a result, most wars were fought tooth and nail. Shanks in back alleys, molotovs indiscriminately thrown through windows, and down to the classic loose pipe or lug wrench. Guns were saved for the big days. When moves were made instead of idle, bloody posturing. And on these days was when the people inside the walls would suffer the most. All semblance of authority ceased as civilians became inconveniences to the warring factions. Food was hoarded in local strongholds and withheld until the fighting was over. During the longest conflicts, cannibalism became the only option for the meager bystander. Even human meat became a subject of central distribution among the starving population.\n\nBut no matter how many wars were fought, any gains made were always temporary.

Sledgehammers were fashioned, crude ladders were constructed, with anything that could possibly chip away at the structure being brought up to the front.

Most had been born behind the walls and had only heard tales of the land beyond. Many others didn't care, and sought to simply survive on whatever they could find. Bands of thousands raided towns, breaking into buildings almost indiscriminately. Few of them had heard of such a thing as a 'store'. To them, it was all the same. Each door and window held a prize for the taking. Each terrified citizen, no matter how clean and decadent they seemed to the people of the Dam, was a symbol of what had imprisoned them for seemingly eternity.

He then spent several years journeying around India and offering his military services to tiny settlements, before ending up in West Bengal, where he enlisted as a guard on the Dam.

Once Bangladesh was swallowed by the ocean, all support from the mainland stopped. Ever since then, East Bengal has fought a forever war against the vestigial Chinese presence in Assam.

The first, led by the noble and revered Prabhu. Lord of the people and now, conqueror of Bangalore. But despite his fame and success, his preached methods were brutal and swift. The intellectuals of Bangalore, and the rest of India if it came to it, would claw themselves tooth and nail into the rungs of their new society, or they would be purged en masse to retain the old ways.\n\nIn the other camp, Saroj. An equally respected figure, if something of a dark horse in Marathis society. His propositions were unorthodox, and to many, outrageous, but it was the intellectuals who dominated here, and few of them could doubt his logic. For the Steel Guard to endure, its society itself must endure a total upheaval. A reformation to appease the new population and make use of them as loyal citizens of a new, more egalitarian system.

Inquiring as to what the man was doing, the man revealed himself to be Raj Thakur, meditating and studying the soil. Thakur then explained to her that he had recently collected a seed from his pilgrimage to Hindu Kush and brought it to Bharat where he had just now planted it before him, a symbol of his will to bring beauty and hope back to India.\n\nThis experience  greatly affected Sibi, who had never observed the natural world in such a light before. Now highly dedicated to Thakur's ideals of sustainability, charity, and environmental living, this position hasn't granted her much favor with Devpura and the leading Pilgrimist party who see her and the Caretaker faction as too narrow-minded and focused on the environment to effectively lead. Her own followers highly regard the environmentalist aspect of Thakurism often proclaiming their opponents to be false followers of Thakur who taint his image.

The fact that Raj Thakur survived the nuclear wastes of Punjab and now radiates a pure aura of wisdom and peace, is a sign of his enlightenment, true divinity.\n\nDevpura was one of the first to really approach Thakur as if he were a divine prophet, becoming a prominent figure in religious Thakurism.

The Pilgrims have adapted Thakur's philosophical standpoints and seemingly fused it with various old religions into a lifestyle that seeks to remove all pain from the world by training the mind and body. The Caretakers have taken a more materialist approach, using Thakur's lessons on environmentalism and sustainability in the effort of restoring India's ecosystem and creating a prosperous and healthy world.\n\nPresident Suresh Devpura himself has very strong ties to the Pilgrim faction, even being a core founder of their movement but has publicly denounced the violence and vandalism of both factions, although as largely fallen on deaf ears. Political opponent Priyanka Sibi, head of the Caretakers, has also called out her followers' aggressive activity but the desperate and high-strung populus are far too distracted to seek diplomatic solutions.\n\nHowever, being one of the last proud republics standing, Rajasthan's upcoming election will be the perfect opportunity for either side to consolidate their influence and move the country however they see fit."

Basing her campaign on the idea of the garden, her followers showed their support by planting seedlings and painting buildings green, emulating the ecological paradise they wish to bring about.\n\nNow, it's a simple matter of counting the votes. Political theorists are expecting that most of the Pilgrimist votes will come from the western territories of Rajasthan which have primarily held strong to the dominant religion of the region throughout history.
