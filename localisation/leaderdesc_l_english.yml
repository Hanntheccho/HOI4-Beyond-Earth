 POLITICS_ELODIE_BATTEUX_DESC:0 "Long wealthy, Élodie's lineage traces back to the nobility and privileged elite of France and Italy a millennia before the Great Mistake. Her family's prestige and influence was not, however, based on its peerage, but rather on the immense fortune it had amassed over the previous two centuries from its holdings in agriculture, food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles.\n\nBorn in Europe's foremost fertility and maternity clinic in Braga, Élodie was her parents' only child. Raised in luxury along the Cote d'Azur and the Costa del Sol, Élodie became a media darling as a teen, although not always portrayed in a flattering light. Accused by her detractors as an isolationist, and a European elitist, Élodie certainly possessed a famously acerbic tongue and quick wit. A strong believer in the value of the Western cultural tradition, she believed that it was up to the educated European elite to guide the masses for their betterment, ensuring the survival of high culture.\n\nThe best way to do this on Earth was the independence and sustainability of the new Union."
 POLITICS_VADIM_KOZLOV_DESC:0 "The most celebrated cosmonaut since Yuri Gagarin, Vadim Kozlov came from a working-class family but rose to heroic stature in the years following the Dark Ages.\n\nEldest son of parents who labored as itinerant steelworkers and welders, Vadim acquired his limited formal education in industrial cities scattered across the Federation. Inducted into the armed forces and immediately given the rank of Colonel, Vadim took advantage of part-time educational programs to gain a comp-diploma in aerospace engineering. Over the next decade, he became the public face of the Federation efforts to exploit the vast resources of space.\n\nIncredibly popular among the working class, a devoted family man, and fiercely loyal to the Slavic state that had rewarded his hard work, Kozlov eschewed offers to enter politics or move into the civilian realm. Vadim Kozlov is the founder of the Slavic Federation, which he sees as a necessary step towards human progress."
 POLITICS_PROKHOR_ZAKHAROV_DESC:0 "Prokhor Zakharov was born in the city of Cherskiy, Russia, during the Dark Ages. His father was a businessman and politician, but early exposure to the corruption of post-Mistake society led the young Zakharov to reject such a "worldly" career. Instead, he pursued an education in the sciences, earning his first degree from the University of Moscow at the age of 18 (largely through Interlink correspondence courses). He then joined the Russian Defense Force, where he exhibited an exceptional aptitude for physics and engineering, sent to the University of Moscow on-site for Masters in engineering. During the warlord period, the Russian Far East was the site of civil unrest and border skirmishes with the Chinese refugees. Zakharov served as a combat engineer in these conflicts, earning a reputation for radical innovation under stressful conditions.\n\nCognitive ability exceedingly high; genius level. Worldview driven almost exclusively through logic. Poor ethical judgment and inability to weigh in emotional factors; moderate deficiency in social functioning. Puts strong reliance on tools and his ability to use and adapt them; this, over human values, represents ultimate good. Ability to work as part of a team towards definable goals invaluable to mission, but poorly defined sense of ethics and tendency toward self-aggrandizement must be closely monitored by ranking superior."
 POLITICS_YANKOV_DANILOVICH_DESC:0 "Yankov Danilovich was never a fan of the University. No amount of propaganda for the "greater good" could convince him that the skeletons in the State's closet were worth it. Yankov attended Moscow University during the warlord period, during which time he was credited with defending the building from bandits. This action led Yankov to being conscripted during the Belorussian Insurrection, where he participated in a BioWeapons unit. Witnessing the horrors of modern warfare firsthand, Yankov began identifying as a pacifist. By the war's conclusion, his inventions netted over 2,000 combat kills, which he denounced as "my evil inventions".\n\nAfter the war, Yankov returned to Moscow University, only to find readmission locked behind a high fee. It was only through the Prokhor's notice of Yankov's abilities was he able to return to his studies. Once the University began to encompass all scientific institutions in the Federation, Yankov had gained enough support among its students so as to form the "Reformist" wing, arguing for strict ethical limits on research, but also started a failed petition to isolate the University from military activities. Now, Yankov Danilovich finds himself at Eurasia's helm, and he vows to never repeat the atrocities of war."
 POLITICS_STRELKOV_DMITRIEVICH_DESC:0 "A child of the Dark Ages, Strelkov was the diamond in the coal. During the warlord times, Eurasia's armies consisted of untrained conscripts, rushed to the front in a desperate attempt to maintain control over the Core Cities. All trained soldiers, veterans of the Central Asian Campaign, fought under warlords. Strelkov was one of the few officers who always stood by Eurasia, and has been credited with destroying over two dozen warlord bands.\n\nNow, Strelkov leads a loose coalition of army units who look to the past for guidance. The Slavic Federation, in their opinion, is a symbol of weakness, its members plagued by decadence. Strelkov, alongside notable commanders like The Titan, have been too powerful for previous governments to quell, and now that Strelkov's clique has taken control over Eurasia, the rest of the world quakes in fear. Russia is back, and Europe is in the crosshairs."
 POLITICS_THE_TITAN_DESC:0 "Little is known about The Titan. He claims to have been born before the Great Mistake, which would make him almost two centuries old. Kept alive through extensive body modifications, The Titan's age has not impeded his quest for a restored Russia. He remembers a time when the Republic was the undisputed hegemon of Europe, the bane of Asia when the cowardly Westerners hid behind their shields.\n\nPartnered with Strelkov Dmitrievich, The Titan is the most radical element within Eurasia. A hardliner, but also a military genius, the man's capabilities are only enhanced by new technology. To him, the world is but a future conquest, achievable via advanced technology, which only Russia has the courage and knowledge to acquire.\n\nNow that the old Marshal has taken leadership over Eurasia, he will stop at nothing to restore Russia's greatness, whatever the costs."
 POLITICS_LENA_EBNER_DESC:0 "Born in Berlin to a German diplomat and a Polish teacher, Lena was raised as a "child of the world". Over the course of 15 years, she lived on four continents and learned to speak eight languages.\n\nLena fought fearlessly for refugee rights throughout central and eastern Europe. Her early work at the Braungart-Wissel Foundation for Environmental Law garnered her acclaim, and she was soon seen as an emerging leader of sustainability and the environmental policymaking. As she became a prominent lawyer-activist in post-Mistake Europe, Lena was an increasingly easy target for Franco-Iberian politicians. Painted as a desperate anarchist, Lena's non-traditional lifestyle and worldview was frequently highlighted in order to polarize moderates. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR.\n\nIt wasn't until Lena's most vocal and harshest critic (and cousin), Élodie, began her campaign for Franco-Iberian politics that Lena's vision for a Transmodern society crystallized. Transmodern meant xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."
 POLITICS_DUNCAN_HUGHES_DESC:0 "Born to a local shipping magnate in the Scottish port city of Aberdeen, Duncan Hughes was something of an enigma when he first appeared on the political circuit roughly a decade ago. Schooled at the Sturgeon Naval College and given an otherwise comfortable upbringing, biographers have long since attributed the quirks of Hughes' personality to his time spent as a teenager working at his father's docks. His father had insisted he work as an apprentice longshoreman to instill a strong work ethic, and yet, the experience seems to have jaded Hughes, as the other dockhands had little regard for "a soft-handed boy underfoot" and paid him only as much attention as required. Still, some might say his father was right - in the present day, Hughes is known as a remarkably tireless man with little fear of difficult confrontations.\n\nHughes is recognized as one of the first to publicly acknowledge the growing gap between the North Sea Alliance's potential versus other world powers. Named as head of the Priority Development Committee, Hughes can be credited with securing many of the trade deals and alliances that allowed for the relatively swift ramp-up to national production."
 POLITICS_OTTAVIANO_ACQUATI_DESC:0 "Ottaviano Acquati has seen his fair share of hardships throughout his life. His family originally came from the cities of the Po Valley that now lie underwater, fleeing to higher ground when the Italian government issued its emergency evacuations. He was thusly born relatively impoverished and often abandoned school to support his family.\n\nHis only saving grace was his innate skill with judicial law. Often reading university law textbooks in his free time, he would grow to become a talented representative in the court of law. Armed with the know-how to make waves in the legal and political world, and the empathy of the fellow environmental refugee, Acquati joined the Partito Sociale, hoping to end the cycle of poverty and suffering that plagued his own upbringing.\n\nThere are but two problems, Franco-Iberia and Padania. The so-called "Liberator" of Europe who has shown nothing but contempt for the weakened nation-states of Europe and seeks to keep Italy split between the Peninsula and Padania. They are tyrants on a continental scale and Acquati will not sit by and watch as this injustice continues. He is Italy's greatest Lawmaker and has represented many cases in his time. Now, he has the task of protecting all of Italy from one of the most powerful nations in the world."
 POLITICS_MATTEO_BOSSI_DESC:0 "Born in Padania before Padania existed, Matteo Bossi is a man of principle. Never seen without a sharp business suit and a spark in his eye, both friends and enemies describe him as innovative and honest, a pioneer in the construction business. Truly, before coming to political office, Matteo inherited a modest contractor firm from his father, a fervent Padanian nationalist. Within ten years, his company had become the go-to on most industrial projects throughout Europe.\n\nFolding his assets in 2183 to run for Novara mayor, Matteo was seen as a symbol of Padania, a success story in spite of the corrupt Italians and overbearing Franco-Iberians. Now, Matteo Bossi turns his eyes inward. Padania is free, yes, but there are many challenges to overcome. With his sights set on the sky and riding a wave of popular support, Matteo Bossi hopes to see Padania become a paradise, and will stop at nothing to see his homeland be truly independent."
 POLITICS_YUG_COMMAND_DESC:0 "The remnants of Army Group South have no real leader. A variety of petty generals, warlords, and raiders preside over their tiny domains. The strongest of this force is Yug Army Command, surviving in the Ural Mountain range. Comprised of aging officers and disgruntled veterans, Command nonetheless wields the largest organized force in the region. It also maintains a direct communications line with Moscow, and is nominally allowed to patrol the Urals."
 POLITICS_IGOR_VALERYEVICH_DESC:0 "Far from home, and far from happiness. Igor Valeryevich is one of the scarce few who remember the Eurasian Republican Movement, and one of the even fewer remaining to have participated in it. The culmination of the movement came in 2156 when its leaders and dedicated followers marched on the capital of Eurasia, to which the military responded by massacring the protestors. After the brutal suppression of the march, many of the republicans were forced to flee and Valeryevich, losing everything, now found himself in Siberia.\n\nSeeking to build himself a new life after the loss of his home and everything he had strived to build, politics again became his foundation, although a lot of his flame had now died out. He was still a political mastermind however and eventually, his staunch dedication to democratic values and his reform of the aging Siberian parliament, landed him as President of Siberia.\n\nNow though, depression is all that fills Valeryevich. He sees the oncoming political storm and he is far too old to continue fighting. The Parliament is urging him to choose a successor, but all the candidates seem consumed with vanity and cannot be trusted with the republican gem he has worked so hard on."
 POLITICS_KARELIAN_DUMA_DESC:0 "To another hundred years!\n\nThe Karelian Duma, a self-proclaimed successor assembly to that of the Russian Federation, resides in the desolate reaches of the far North. Isolated from the bulk of former revolutionary forces in Siberia, the situation in Karelia worsens by the day. Constant equipment shortages, corruption, ethnic tensions between Slavs and migrating Finnish tribes have taken their toll on the rump state.\n\nDue to the Byzantine politics of the Republic, the Duma has no president or acting representative - instead, every member is entitled to a vote and theoretically represents a region of old Russia - even if they had never been there. Decision-making is only possible due to the shared hatred of Eurasia, which sits over the lake, bidding its time until Karelia is starved out. The Duma has other plans."
 POLITICS_RASKALOV_YAKOVICH_DESC:0 "Liev Ganin never understood warfare in a technical sense. Having cheated his way through the Suvorov Military Academy, he found himself armed and sent into the meatgrinder of Central Asia. The campaign dragged on for many years, claiming all of Liev's friends.\n\nThe Great Rout came at the climax of of the campaign in 2157, by which point Liev's skill for improvisation and limited tactical expertise had landed him the undesirable position of general. Following the migration of Army Group South into the Urals, Liev settled in the mountain chain, drinking his sorrows away. However, either semi-consciously or through gritted teeth, Liev Ganin is digging up old hatchets."
 POLITICS_PROKHOR_ZAKHAROV_DESC:0 "Prokhor Zakharov was born in the city of Cherskiy, Russia, during the Dark Ages. His father was a businessman and politician, but early exposure to the corruption of post-Mistake society led the young Zakharov to reject such a "worldly" career.

 POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DUPONT_DESC:0 "François Dupont served in the military police at the end of the Dark Days, only to be promoted to general after the mass departure of veterans. He never participated directly in a war, but his work within the friendly lines earned him a reputation as an iron fist, especially with immigrants, political prisoners and his own comrades. He always maintained a nationalist discourse in favour of the Union, accompanied by a ridiculously centralised and unified vision of it. Anyone who held an opinion contrary to his own became ungrateful to him.\n\nHe trained at the military academy in Paris, and was active in the then Parti Unioniste Conservador, which was based in the same city. The party was dissolved after his promotion and he joined the Partido Nationale. Although he did not consider himself a supporter of Élodie, he always supported the new party and his country with pride.\n\nWhile his own friends describe him as a steadfast and consistent person, what stands out most about Dupont is his high motive for power, his hidden ambition, his wet dream to reform the Federation into a strong state capable of standing up to its enemies and to itself. One that can maintain its personality and not allow others to destroy its culture, whatever the cost. His pride in Franco-Iberia is unparalleled, and he would do anything in his power to keep it alive. For Dupont, what his country stands for is not just Westernism, but purity, character, strength and brotherhood among its members, and freedom for those who accept it as such."
