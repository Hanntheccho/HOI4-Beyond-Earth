 POLITICS_ELODIE_BATTEUX_DESC:0 "Long wealthy, Élodie's lineage traces back to the nobility and privileged elite of France and Italy a millennia before the Great Mistake. Her family's prestige and influence was not, however, based on its peerage, but rather on the immense fortune it had amassed over the previous two centuries from its holdings in agriculture, food processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles.\n\nBorn in Europe's foremost fertility and maternity clinic in Braga, Élodie was her parents' only child. Raised in luxury along the Cote d'Azur and the Costa del Sol, Élodie became a media darling as a teen, although not always portrayed in a flattering light. Accused by her detractors as an isolationist, and a European elitist, Élodie certainly possessed a famously acerbic tongue and quick wit. A strong believer in the value of the Western cultural tradition, she believed that it was up to the educated European elite to guide the masses for their betterment, ensuring the survival of high culture.\n\nThe best way to do this on Earth was the independence and sustainability of the new Union."
 POLITICS_VADIM_KOZLOV_DESC:0 "The most celebrated cosmonaut since Yuri Gagarin, Vadim Kozlov came from a working-class family but rose to heroic stature in the years following the Dark Ages.\n\nEldest son of parents who labored as itinerant steelworkers and welders, Vadim acquired his limited formal education in industrial cities scattered across the Federation. Inducted into the armed forces and immediately given the rank of Colonel, Vadim took advantage of part-time educational programs to gain a comp-diploma in aerospace engineering. Over the next decade, he became the public face of the Federation efforts to exploit the vast resources of space. Vadim Kozlov was the first citizen of the Federation to set foot on Mars.\n\nIncredibly popular among the working class, a devoted family man, and fiercely loyal to the Slavic state that had rewarded his hard work, Kozlov eschewed offers to enter politics or move into the civilian realm. At the age of 35, he was overseeing Roscosmos construction projects on Earth, Mars, and in space.\n\nVadim Kozlov is the founder of the Slavic Federation, which he sees as a necessary step towards human progress."
 POLITICS_PROKHOR_ZAKHAROV_DESC:0 "Prokhor Zakharov was born in the city of Cherskiy, Russia, during the Dark Ages. His father was a businessman and politician, but early exposure to the corruption of post-Mistake society led the young Zakharov to reject such a "worldly" career. Instead, he pursued an education in the sciences, earning his first degree from the University of Moscow at the age of 18 (largely through Interlink correspondence courses). He then joined the Russian Defense Force, where he exhibited an exceptional aptitude for physics and engineering, sent to the University of Moscow on-site for Masters in engineering. During the warlord period, the Russian Far East was the site of civil unrest and border skirmishes with the Chinese refugees. Zakharov served as a combat engineer in these conflicts, earning a reputation for radical innovation under stressful conditions.\n\nCognitive ability exceedingly high; genius level. Worldview driven almost exclusively through logic. Poor ethical judgment and inability to weigh in emotional factors; moderate deficiency in social functioning. Puts strong reliance on tools and his ability to use and adapt them; this, over human values, represents ultimate good. Ability to work as part of a team towards definable goals invaluable to mission, but poorly defined sense of ethics and tendency toward self-aggrandizement must be closely monitored by ranking superior."
 POLITICS_YANKOV_DANILOVICH_DESC:0 "Yankov Danilovich was never a fan of the University. No amount of propaganda for the "greater good" could convince him that the skeletons in the State's closet were worth it. Yankov attended Moscow University during the warlord period, during which time he was credited with defending the building from bandits. This action led Yankov to being conscripted during the Belorussian Insurrection, where he participated in a BioWeapons unit. Witnessing the horrors of modern warfare firsthand, Yankov began identifying as a pacifist. By the war's conclusion, his inventions netted over 2,000 combat kills, which he denounced as "my evil inventions".\n\nAfter the war, Yankov returned to Moscow University, only to find readmission locked behind a high fee. It was only through the Prokhor's notice of Yankov's abilities was he able to return to his studies. Once the University began to encompass all scientific institutions in the Federation, Yankov had gained enough support among its students so as to form the "Reformist" wing, arguing for strict ethical limits on research, but also started a failed petition to isolate the University from military activities. Now, Yankov Danilovich finds himself at Eurasia's helm, and he vows to never repeat the atrocities of war."
 POLITICS_STRELKOV_DMITRIEVICH_DESC:0 "A child of the Dark Ages, Strelkov was the diamond in the coal. During the warlord times, Eurasia's armies consisted of untrained conscripts, rushed to the front in a desperate attempt to maintain control over the Core Cities. All trained soldiers, veterans of the Central Asian Campaign, fought under warlords. Strelkov was one of the few officers who always stood by Eurasia, and has been credited with destroying over two dozen warlord bands.\n\nNow, Strelkov leads a loose coalition of army units who look to the past for guidance. The Slavic Federation, in their opinion, is a symbol of weakness, its members plagued by decadence. Strelkov, alongside notable commanders like The Titan, have been too powerful for previous governments to quell, and now that Strelkov's clique has taken control over Eurasia, the rest of the world quakes in fear. Russia is back, and Europe is in the crosshairs."
 POLITICS_THE_TITAN_DESC:0 "Little is known about The Titan. He claims to have been born before the Great Mistake, which would make him almost two centuries old. Kept alive through extensive body modifications, The Titan's age has not impeded his quest for a restored Russia. He remembers a time when the Republic was the undisputed hegemon of Europe, the bane of Asia when the cowardly Westerners hid behind their shields.\n\nPartnered with Strelkov Dmitrievich, The Titan is the most radical element within Eurasia. A hardliner, but also a military genius, the man's capabilities are only enhanced by new technology. To him, the world is but a future conquest, achievable via advanced technology, which only Russia has the courage and knowledge to acquire.\n\nNow that the old Marshal has taken leadership over Eurasia, he will stop at nothing to restore Russia's greatness, whatever the costs."
 POLITICS_LENA_EBNER_DESC:0 "Born in Berlin to a German diplomat and a Polish teacher, Lena was raised as a "child of the world". Over the course of 15 years, she lived on four continents and learned to speak eight languages.\n\nLena fought fearlessly for refugee rights throughout central and eastern Europe. Her early work at the Braungart-Wissel Foundation for Environmental Law garnered her acclaim, and she was soon seen as an emerging leader of sustainability and the environmental policymaking. As she became a prominent lawyer-activist in post-Mistake Europe, Lena was an increasingly easy target for Franco-Iberian politicians. Painted as a desperate anarchist, Lena's non-traditional lifestyle and worldview was frequently highlighted in order to polarize moderates. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR.\n\nIt wasn't until Lena's most vocal and harshest critic (and cousin), Élodie, began her campaign for Franco-Iberian politics that Lena's vision for a Transmodern society crystallized. Transmodern meant xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."
 POLITICS_DUNCAN_HUGHES_DESC:0 "Born to a local shipping magnate in the Scottish port city of Aberdeen, Duncan Hughes was something of an enigma when he first appeared on the political circuit roughly a decade ago. Schooled at the Sturgeon Naval College and given an otherwise comfortable upbringing, biographers have long since attributed the quirks of Hughes' personality to his time spent as a teenager working at his father's docks. His father had insisted he work as an apprentice longshoreman to instill a strong work ethic, and yet, the experience seems to have jaded Hughes, as the other dockhands had little regard for "a soft-handed boy underfoot" and paid him only as much attention as required. Still, some might say his father was right - in the present day, Hughes is known as a remarkably tireless man with little fear of difficult confrontations.\n\nHughes is recognized as one of the first to publicly acknowledge the growing gap between the North Sea Alliance's potential versus other world powers. Named as head of the Priority Development Committee, Hughes can be credited with securing many of the trade deals and alliances that allowed for the relatively swift ramp-up to national production."
 POLITICS_OTTAVIANO_ACQUATI_DESC:0 "Ottaviano Acquati has seen his fair share of hardships throughout his life. His family originally came from the cities of the Po Valley that now lie underwater, fleeing to higher ground when the Italian government issued its emergency evacuations. He was thusly born relatively impoverished and often abandoned school to support his family.\n\nHis only saving grace was his innate skill with judicial law. Often reading university law textbooks in his free time, he would grow to become a talented representative in the court of law. Armed with the know-how to make waves in the legal and political world, and the empathy of the fellow environmental refugee, Acquati joined the Partito Sociale, hoping to end the cycle of poverty and suffering that plagued his own upbringing.\n\nThere are but two problems, Franco-Iberia and Padania. The so-called "Liberator" of Europe who has shown nothing but contempt for the weakened nation-states of Europe and seeks to keep Italy split between the Peninsula and Padania. They are tyrants on a continental scale and Acquati will not sit by and watch as this injustice continues. He is Italy's greatest Lawmaker and has represented many cases in his time. Now, he has the task of protecting all of Italy from one of the most powerful nations in the world."
