  PRU_the_andean_century_desc:0 "The century turns yet again, but the Andes stand tall. The world is crumbling under the pressure of ancient struggles and climate change, but the Andean Compact is stronger than ever. Bolstered by international investors, vast energy reserves, a literate population and good geography, the Compact is widely recognized as a world power. The citizens of the Compact enjoy many social, economic, and technological freedoms that are rare in other parts of the world. The Compact is in its golden age - and it's going to last."
  PRU_the_lithium_business:0 "The Lithium Business"
  PRU_the_lithium_business_desc:0 "Old Peru and Old Bolivia are home to some of the world's largest lithium reserves. Monopolized by local indegenous groups, the Lithium trade is one of the pillars on which the entire Compact rests. While international trade isn't quite as extensive as in pre-Mistake times, the export of lithium has made the Andes rich and powerful."
  PRU_economic_decentralization_crippling:0 "Economic Decentralization: §RCrippling§!"
  PRU_economic_decentralization_crippling_desc:0 "As of now, major corporations and interest groups control this country's economy. The government has little say on where to build, what to build, and when to build it. Any and all legislation is instantly met with a flurry of push backs and filibustering, while the parties are too busy fighting one another to form a united front."
  PRU_military_decentralization_extensive:0 "Military Decentralization: Extensive"
  PRU_military_decentralization_extensive_desc:0 "As of now, this country's military is partially under the control of corporations and interest groups. The government has limited control over a patchwork of militias, mercenaries, and a few official divisions whose loyalty is a little more than questionable. On the plus side, companies fund and equip their own forces out of pocket."
