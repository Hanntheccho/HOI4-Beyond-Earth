 SEI_the_migration_problem_desc:0 "The local population of this District is in a constant state of flux. Refugees from old Louisiana still inhabit the Eastern coast, but regularly undergo famine as the fishing industry declines. Meanwhile, bandits and tribes from Mexico travel Northwards annually in search of more suitable climates. The recent uprising in Southern Mexico has further fueled this migration, and thousands are making their way through the border. This issue is continually destabilizing District 6 and will lend much political capital to whoever manages to resolve it."

 SEI_political_battleground_desc:0 "District 6 is currently divided between ARC and Central loyalists. The former, led by Vice President Suzane Fielding herself, consists primarily of middle-class supporters and those who stand to benefit by extensive reclamation projects along the Eastern coast. On the other end, Central loyalists are led by Axton Barron, the former representative of District 6 before his ostracization from politics in the 80s. Now, having recovered much of his political capital, Barron has returned to re-secure old Texas in the name of Central. His support is primarily drawn from rich elites and power brokers who have a vested interest in attaining Central relief aid."

 POLITICS_SUZANNE_FIELDING_DESC:0 "Suzanne Fielding was born the eldest of three daughters to a Mexican-born mother, and an African-American father in April, 2161.  Growing up close to the Gulf Coast of Texas, she helped her father manage the three hardware stores he owned in the state - the fruits of the Central government's attempts to "revitalize" the region's economy after the 3rd American Civil War's so-called "War of Unification".  Although Central would abandon direct control of District 6 along with much of the country, Fielding exploited what opportunity was given by graduating from San Antonio's Trinity University with a double Majors in Accounting and Economics. Since then, she has made considerable progress in building a support base stretching from her native Texas to ARC itself."
