 superbug_event.1.t: "Superbugs Crisis in Germany"
 superbug_event.1.d: "Authorities in Germany have reported a recent unprecedented spread of not just a single, but multiple strains of superbugs.\n\nFor years, the misuse of antibiotics ignored by governments has led to the emergence of never-before-seen superbugs in threatening numbers. It is important to understand that these bacteria are not just any bacteria. They are bacteria that have generated resistance to multiple antibiotics, unknown until their uselessness in patients is observed. Small groups of researchers are fighting side by side to reduce the effects of the bacteria, starting with the symptoms and working their way up to wiping out the new microscopic enemies. Some vaccine prototypes have already been developed, but it is expected that as the inevitable pandemic progresses, new bacteria will emerge that will quickly render the latest advances obsolete.\n\nAlso report that corporations such as Alchemax Corp, the world's largest corporation, have "altruistically" pledged to start their own research project in case it gets worse."

 superbug_event.2.t: "Superbugs Global Crisis"
 superbug_event.2.d: "Superbugs have spread throughout the world. Many people are dying, getting sick, or shutting themselves up in their homes. Some regional authorities have persuaded people to stay indoors and avoid travelling.\n\nAlchemax Corp. makes available to any institution its advances in the research, which are still under development. It is hoped that the cure can be developed more rapidly as the team of scientists expands and new laboratory materials developed by the Berlin Research Institute arrive. These materials and machinery would enable faster and more efficient isolation and analysis of bacteria, with the help of next-generation artificial intelligence.\n\nGovernments are busy avoiding public discomfort, while our health and future remains potentially dependent on corporations. Let's hope Alchemax Corp.'s altruism is as real as the cure development."
 superbug_event_option.2.a: "Sounds familiar"
 superbug_event.3.t: "The Definitive Cure!"
 superbug_event.3.d: "Alchemax Corp. and the Berlin Research Institute have developed a technique that would allow them to solve the superbugs crisis easly. The latest advances in the industry will allow the production of the so-called "bacteriophages", or just "phages", at high speed, avoiding bottlenecks and potential clashes between countries over the cure.\n\nPhages have the ability to replicate rapidly by infecting bacteria. Their name comes from the Greek "phagein", meaning "to devour". Studies over the past few years have been undertaken to develop a cure using these micro-organisms, which are in fact viruses, and which are also very abundant in the biosphere and the ultimate alternative to antibiotics.\n\nGermany itself has offered to produce the cure from recycled and biodegradable materials, with the aim of reducing a potentially unnecessary increase in the ecological footprint. There is no evidence that producing the cure with these materials would meet the goal of high-speed production, so Alchemax Corp. has stated that it will produce them in parallel despite complaints from the German government."
