 #GOVERNMENT
 government_style:0 "Government Style"
 synthetic_democracy:0 "Synthetic Technocracy"
 synthetic_democracy_desc:0 "Technocracy is a government based on meritocratic principles - that is, individuals are given leadership positions based on prior performance and qualifications, rather than inheritance or popular decree. Technocratic governments prize competition and advancement, but are prone to corruption amidst a massive bureaucracy.\n\nSome technocracies implenent limited use of AI and machines in their government, to streamline processes and carry out routine tasks."
 corporate_libertarianism:0 "Minarchist State"
 corporate_libertarianism_desc:0 "Although rare in pre-Mistake society, minarchist governments have grown and expanded following a growing distrust in worldwide governments.\n\nIn a minarchist society, all government is kept to a minimum. Only by the use of minor taxes and government contracts does centralized action take place. Instead, a large part of the country is driven by interest groups, formed by either corporate interests, or people's organizations."
 digital_democracy:0 "Digital Democracy"
 digital_democracy_desc:0 "With the advent of globalism and mass communications, many governments were forced to cede power to their citizens. Continuing the prized legacy of popular government and the Social Contract, democracies are highly transparent, reducing corruption and backdoor deals.\n\nUnfourtunately, increased political participation, combined with mass media, contribute to a very polarized society, where passing even the simplest of bills is a long and complicated process."
 military_government:0 "Military Autocracy"
 military_government_desc:0 "Following the Great Mistake, even the mightiest of nations faltered and fell into the abyss of a new Dark Age. To salvage the situation, military groups took over certain countries, ruling with an iron (and sometimes, a just) fist. Although such military governments claim to be a temporary measure, many exist for the sake of perpetuating an elite group.\n\nThe main aim of this form of government is to defend at all cost the way of life of the nation and preserve the national unity."
 communal_parity:0 "Communal Parity"
 communal_parity_desc:0 "A radical democracy in which there is no head of government. Instead power is devolved to local councils consisting of all individuals of that community, who then are able to send representatives to higher councils for regional or national matters. Representative in any field is not a permanent role and is elected only when required.\n\nIssues are voted on directly by all those who it would effect with consensus, not majority, being the objective."
 anarchy_style:0 "Unstable Government"
 anarchy_style_desc:0 "An unstable government can be many things. Ranging from the absense of civilization to failed anarchist experiments, from massive mobs to unorthodox governments, an unstable government has difficulties in everything.\n\nPassing laws is borderline impossible, corruption can be found in all aspects of society, and the state (or what remains of it) is usually unable to collect taxes or field proper armies."

 #SUPERBUGS (OLD)
 superbugs:0 "Superbugs' Expansion"
 superbugs_desc:0 "An increasing superbugs' expansion is leading to an increase of demand on health resources, as well as killing the elderly in a national level."


 SOV_fires_of_siberia:0 "Fires of Siberia"
 SOV_centralized_military:0 "Centralized Military"
 SOV_slavic_federation:0 "Slavic Federation"
 SOV_fires_of_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia is burning. The Great Mistake has not only flooded the Vorkuta region but wiped entire cities off the map. The Caspian's sudden expansion shattered the Central Asian campaign of 2154, cutting off our nation's access to Asia. Entire steppes are catching fire, while warlord remnants continue to harass those who dare venture outside the Core Cities. Restoring Siberia to its former beauty is an impossible task, but we can still try and salvage what is left."
 SOV_centralized_military_desc:0 "The Eurasian Military, composed of the Army, Navy, Air and Space branches, is very young. Most soldiers are veterans of the Dark Ages, and many are still loyal to local warlords. Recent efforts to centralize the military around the "Verhuvnaya Commanda", based in the capital, have not been as successful as hoped. It would be naive to believe that the ragged men we call "soldiers" have anything but money in mind. All future campaigns should be executed quickly, lest the officers decide to switch loyalties."
 SOV_slavic_federation_desc:0 "The Slavic Federation is less of a unitary entity and more of an alliance of convenience. Eurasia, still viewing itself as the protector of "junior" Slavic peoples, sends out regular relief aid to other members. While a uniting force amongst our peoples, conservative elements of society argue for a more aggressive approach towards exerting foreign influence and believe that the Federation is more of a liability than a strength.\n\nBeing Kozlov's brainchild, he is unlikely to give it up, but there are rumors of growing discontent amongst its members."

 GER_green_austerity:0 "Green Austerity"
 GER_anti_franco_iberian_desc:0 "Lena Ebner represents a watershed moment in the history of post-Mistake Europe. An event of this magnitude occurs only once a generation. Billed as "a response to the new imperialism", what actually this means is nothing less than a cogent new political philosophy, neither right nor left, dominionist nor green. A strong posture against Franco-Iberian agenda."
 GER_transhumanism_desc:0 "The "aristocratic spirit of seriousness" and "Ancien Regime of Western rationalistic technocracy" have motivated the politics of this age, with the agents of the state and entertainment serving as gatekeepers for what is "good" and what is "bad" for the people. Transmodernism means xenophily, globalism, and a place for both tradition and modernity."
 GER_green_austerity_desc:0 "Lena bridged the gap between technocrat, activist, and environmentalist. In fact, it was Lena herself who suggested the Party restructure their organization under those three verticals. It was Lena's suggestions for radical measures in everything from economic and environmental policy to urban planning and foreign affairs that underlined the difference between the "old fashioned imperials" of Franco-Iberia and the new techno-green ideology of INTEGR."
 SCO_the_nsa:0 "The NSA"
 SCO_the_arks:0 "The ARKs"
 SCO_sea_never_sleeps:0 "The Sea Never Sleeps"
 SCO_sea_never_sleeps_desc:0 "The mountains stand firm as the tides turn far below, rising and falling. This is how it's been since the dawn of time. However, now the sea comes in sweeping lives, towns, and entire cities out to sea, never to be seen again. Though other people cry and weep before they give in to the sea, we do not, and will not. As always we fight, for once, not with sword and rifle but with shovel and crane. Even now, we lead a war against the very sea itself, reclaiming from its depths what it has stolen. Massive pipes pump water away, as with steel and concrete we build vast walls to reclaim land and keep the sea out."
 SCO_the_arks_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the project's divine namesake, we have built great cities upon the sea that have taken so much. Each city is an ark, to preserve humanity, an industrial monument of economy and skill. Each one is a hub of human traffic, as everyone seeks a place on the arks. Demand outweighs supply as usual during a disaster."
 SCO_the_nsa_desc:0 "The North Sea Alliance is a great idea, one that could bear powerful fruit. For now it is an alliance crumbling from within as old rivalries resurface and delusions of grandeur seep into the politics. This is exemplified by the two most powerful members, Scotland and England. England shudders and wails in pain as it crumbles from within, vultures fighting over her heart. Scotland strives to make a new future separate from England, but fears the chaos of the South and English stubbornness. Though if these troubles can be overcome, it shall grow in strength as new member states join the pact, fulfilling its namesake as it claims dominion over the North Sea."
 ITA_padania_moment:0 "Padanian Revanchism"
 ITA_rich_exodus:0 "Rich Exodus"
 ITA_partito_sociale:0 "Il Partito Sociale"
 ITA_padania_moment_desc:0 "During the Dark Days, the northern regions of Italy slowly became more economically and socially distant from the rest of the country. Wealth disparity and the identification of the North as too distinct from the remainder of the country became more common as the decades went by. Eventually, the flooding of the Po Valley solidified the boundary between North and Central Italy.\n\nMounting tensions led to an independence referendum, concluding with Padania becoming a separate sovereign entity apart from Italy, enticing various aristocrats and millionaires who sought to make Padania a haven for the elite and powerful, a 2nd Switzerland of old, where the rich from all over the world can indulge in luxury and ensure their financial security."
 ITA_rich_exodus_desc:0 "When Padania voted to leave Italy, many of the country's rich and powerful jumped ship and took all of their wealth to the young nation up north. Italy then was left with scraps, recoiling from the environmental refugee crisis, and now suffering a massive economic collapse as investments no longer flowed into the economy. It can now be barely considered a formidable player in economical terms, but with Partito Sociale, perhaps that will change."
 ITA_partito_sociale_desc:0 "With the division of the country on new international lines, the poor and desperate populus called upon a shining beacon to raise them out of the dirt. Partito Sociale is the glowing torch that has rescued so many from constant suffering, enacting new social policies and cracking down on exploitation.\n\nWith the peninsula firmly united under the Red Star, the party has pointed blame squarely on the insufferable capitalists in the north, the traitors who have abandoned their nation for wealth."
 PAD_fi_tension:0 "Franco-Iberian Question"
 PAD_ita_tension:0 "Italian Question"
 PAD_homeland_ofthe_rich:0 "Homeland of the Rich"
 PAD_fi_tension_desc:0 "Padania was founded on the principle of freedom. Freedom from those would would drag us into destruction, and Freedom from the those at the top who wish to suppress any sort of growth or progress. The leader of Franco-Iberia has made her ambitions quite clear, she wishes to see Padania incorporated into the Union, pulling us back into the same fray we voted to leave in the first place. This outrageous claim threatens to destroy everything this country was founded upon.\n\nShe clearly doesn't care about unity or solidarity, this is simply a matter of accruing more wealth for her hegemonic empire. As such, the nation is quite evenly split between those who welcome Elodie and those who don't."
 PAD_ita_tension_desc:0 "Padania is ethnically very similar to its motherland on its southern border. Most people speak, eat, act, cook and dress Italian but the core dividing factor is the belief in human progress. Before Padania came into existence, northern Italy was one of the only productive centres on the peninsula. Business owners did what they could to get people working but with an environmental crisis, a deflating economy and radicals proclaiming that it was all the fault of the business owner, it became clear that Italy was but a shadow of its former self, a rotting carcass of a country.\n\nPadania merely got out while it could and took its philosophy of hard work, ingenuity and progress with it. The people who remain in Italy are those who fail to see how we are just moving towards future, and hate us for our prosperity."
 PAD_homeland_ofthe_rich_desc:0 "Success breeds more Success, as some would say, and it is definitely not a falsehood in Padania. With its newly gained independence came thousands of rich investors and entrepreneurial from all corners of the globe.\n\nIn essence, Padania was a second Switzerland of old, a haven for multi-billion dollar conglomerates and a prime headquarters for CEOs and international banking, with money flowing out in the streets. Some gaze up at Padania with disguised envy or furious hatred, but none can doubt the nation's limitless prosperity."

 URA_siberia_burns_desc:0 "In the Ural Mountains, simple survival is a challenge. Rampant forest fires, unpredictable floods, and roving marauders make life impossible. Those who could, have already fled. Those who remain, they are the dead. All that remains is the fire of the wasteland."
 URA_no_army:0 "No Army, No State, No Nothing"
 URA_no_army_desc:0 "The Urals are inhabited by the remnants of Army Group South. Originally a grand Eurasian force sent to reinforce the rapidly deteriorating situation in old Kazakhstan, the entire army routed due to a variety of reasons, including poor supply and low morale. The collapse of the campaign led to most of the army retreating past the Urals. The decentralized government in Eurasia failed to rally the deserters, and instead relied upon the League to stem the inflow of Far Eastern refugees.\n\n But for the people of the Urals, there is nothing left. The villages are reduced to ash, the people empty husks. Once proud-soldiers, now reduced to pillaging. What lies ahead, a dense fog."
 SIB_inhospitable_climate:0 "Inhospitable Climate"
 SIB_inhospitable_climate_desc:0 "When the Great Mistake grew to encompass Siberia, some thought that Siberia would benefit. How wrong they were. All across the Siberian landscape, uncontrolled fires are spreading. Rivers have expanded to swallow entire towns. Acid rain has become a common sight. But the sky remains grey."
 SIB_one_land:0 "One Land, Two Peoples"
 SIB_one_land_desc:0 "Roughly half of Siberia's population consists of migrant Chinese. Local minorities have long been displaced and forgotten, but Russian nationalists dominate the government. Any type of cohesion is impossible as long as either side is hostile to the other."
 SIB_xibolia_lu:0 "Luo Zhenxian"
 SIB_xibolia_lu_desc:0 "The infamous Luo Zhenxian, or Siberian Brigade, was hastily organized by the old Chinese government during the mass exodus of Northern populations into Siberia. Originally tasked with protecting refugees by working with local Siberian authorities, the brigade's leader, Lei Chang, has grown disillusioned with the treatment of refugees in the icy wastes.\n\nThe Luo Zhenxian now wages an undercover war against Sibir, and if not stopped in time, may cause the total collapse of Russian authority in the region."
 KAR_keepers_of_revolution:0 "Keepers Of The Revolutionary Flame"
 KAR_keepers_of_revolution_desc:0 "The Russian Republic, currently based in Karelia, is the descendant of the failed Republican Revolution of 2156. Once encompassing much of Siberia and old Russia, the Revolution has fortified its peninsula in hopes of waiting out the Moscow Regime. But as Eurasia grows stronger by the day, the Russian Republic must strike soon or die."
 KAR_finno_slavic_tension:0 "Finno-Slavic Tensions"
 KAR_finno_slavic_tension_desc:0 "The Karelian lands have long been emptied of their namesake population - what is left are squabbling tribes of Slavs and Finnish refugees fleeing from the West. National divisions are high, and although the Republic preaches peace between the two groups, daily brawls and shootouts are not an uncommon sight."
 FRA_fi_failed:0 "Conseil Nacional d'Urgence"
 FRA_fi_failed_desc:0 "Our leaders have brought us to the brink. The population is tired, soldiers are turning against their own commanders, people are hiding, fleeing. Some regional leaders have already threatened to leave the Union unilaterally. The country is doomed if we do not act quickly. That is the reason for the Conseil Nacional d'Urgence. We will fight for the integrity of the Union even if we die trying, it will die with us and we with it. We will purge if necessary the ranks, the generals, the political leaders. Nothing can stand in the way of our noble cause.\n\n§RUnion or Death!§!"

#YUGOSLAVIA IDEA

 YUG_the_communalists:0 "The Communalist Threat"
 YUG_the_communalists_desc:0 "For a couple of years now, polarisation in the Balkans has been echoed around the world, especially on the European continent. The green-socialist coalition, calling itself the "communalists", is campaigning for care for the Earth through a more centralised and less unequal economy. Radical anti-capitalist groups have also joined the coalition in order to end what they see as the reason for the Great Mistake and global warming: capitalism.\n\nOn the other hand, more moderate, conservative and even far-right sectors have joined the polarisation game, especially the less moderate groups. The so-called "National Sovereignty Coalition" believes that the Balkan Federation is being influenced by other powers, especially Germany and its leading initiative, INTEGR. The green coalition is being nurtured by the Initiative, in order to provoke a civil rupture and to be able to intervene in its favour."

#NSA AND ALIGNED

 GER_green_soil_plan:0 "Green Soil Plan"
 GER_green_soil_plan_desc:0 "Poland and the Czech Republic were not affected by the Great Mistake with the same intensity compared to other countries or their own neighbour, Germany. For this reason the "Green Soil" plan was signed by these three countries in 2194 with the aim of maintaining a dynamic, mutually supportive and green economy.\n\nSince then, relations between the three countries have only improved. In both countries the Initiative has great social support and is seen as the future of the region and of Europe as a whole.\n\nThe reality is that this treaty has led to an interdependence between the signatory countries, where if the economy of one were to fall, the economy of the other would be seriously affected. That is why the engagement between these countries will be long-lasting and prosperous, as long as the ambitions of European leaders do not get in the way."
