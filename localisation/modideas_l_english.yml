 FRA_second_renaissance_desc:0 "The Federation of Franco-Iberia is undergoing a Second Renaissance, as the PAN (Programe Artistice National, in english, National Artistic Program) is funding new and rising artists and the Directorate-General for Education and Culture is promoting european artworks and opening art museums, but there is more, the government has created associations for cinema, comic, sculpture and even origami. The cultural boom the federation has seems unstoppable."
 FRA_mediterranean_business_desc:0 "The Mediterranean Sea gives Franco-Iberia a very good place to trade and access to minerals and population, this is why the Mediterranean is more important than ever for Franco-Iberia. During the floods, the sea seemed like a curse, but now it can be considered the jewel of the nation."
 FRA_federal_assembly_desc:0 "The Federal Assembly is the parliament of Franco-Iberia, they vote the national decisions and control what the president does, it is one of the most respected things about Franco-Iberia, its democratic system. All representers are voted directly by the population using cutting-edge technology in voting systems, updating the feedback and making it easier than ever being heard."

 synthetic_democracy:0 "Synthetic Technocracy"
 synthetic_democracy_desc:0 "Technocracy is a government based on meritocratic principles - that is, individuals are given leadership positions based on prior performance and qualifications, rather than inheritance or popular decree. Technocratic governments prize competition and advancement, but are prone to corruption amidst a massive bureaucracy.\n\nSome technocracies implenent limited use of AI and machines in their government, to streamline processes and carry out routine tasks."
 corporate_libertarianism:0 "Minarchist State"
 corporate_libertarianism_desc:0 "Although rare in pre-Mistake society, minarchist governments have grown and expanded following a growing distrust in worldwide governments.\n\nIn a minarchist society, all government is kept to a minimum. Only by the use of minor taxes and government contracts does centralized action take place. Instead, a large part of the country is driven by interest groups, formed by either corporate interests, or people's organizations."
 digital_democracy:0 "Digital Democracy"
 digital_democracy_desc:0 "With the advent of globalism and mass communications, many governments were forced to cede power to their citizens. Continuing the prized legacy of popular government and the Social Contract, democracies are highly transparent, reducing corruption and backdoor deals.\n\nUnfourtunately, increased political participation, combined with mass media, contribute to a very polarized society, where passing even the simplest of bills is a long and complicated process."
 military_government:0 "Military Autocracy"
 military_government_desc:0 "Following the Great Mistake, even the mightiest of nations faltered and fell into the abyss of a new Dark Age. To salvage the situation, military groups took over certain countries, ruling with an iron (and sometimes, a just) fist. Although such military governments claim to be a temporary measure, many exist for the sake of perpetuating an elite group.\n\nThe main aim of this form of government is to defend at all cost the way of life of the nation and preserve the national unity."
 communal_parity:0 "Communal Parity"
 communal_parity_desc:0 "A radical democracy in which there is no head of government. Instead power is devolved to local councils consisting of all individuals of that community, who then are able to send representatives to higher councils for regional or national matters. Representative in any field is not a permanent role and is elected only when required.\n\nIssues are voted on directly by all those who it would effect with consensus, not majority, being the objective."
 anarchy_style:0 "Unstable Government"
 anarchy_style_desc:0 "An unstable government can be many things. Ranging from the absense of civilization to failed anarchist experiments, from massive mobs to unorthodox governments, an unstable government has difficulties in everything.\n\nPassing laws is borderline impossible, corruption can be found in all aspects of society, and the state (or what remains of it) is usually unable to collect taxes or field proper armies."
 superbugs:0 "Superbugs' Expansion"
 superbugs_desc:0 "An increasing superbugs' expansion is leading to an increase of demand on health resources, as well as killing the elderly in a national level."
 SOV_fires_of_siberia:0 "Fires of Siberia"
 SOV_centralized_military:0 "Centralized Military"
 SOV_slavic_federation:0 "Slavic Federation"
 SOV_fires_of_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia is burning. The Great Mistake has not only flooded the Vorkuta region but wiped entire cities off the map. The Caspian's sudden expansion shattered the Central Asian campaign of 2154, cutting off our nation's access to Asia. Entire steppes are catching fire, while warlord remnants continue to harass those who dare venture outside the Core Cities. Restoring Siberia to its former beauty is an impossible task, but we can still try and salvage what is left."
 SOV_centralized_military_desc:0 "The Eurasian Military, composed of the Army, Navy, Air and Space branches, is very young. Most soldiers are veterans of the Dark Ages, and many are still loyal to local warlords. Recent efforts to centralize the military around the "Verhuvnaya Commanda", based in the capital, have not been as successful as hoped. It would be naive to believe that the ragged men we call "soldiers" have anything but money in mind. All future campaigns should be executed quickly, lest the officers decide to switch loyalties."
 SOV_slavic_federation_desc:0 "The Slavic Federation is less of a unitary entity and more of an alliance of convenience. Eurasia, still viewing itself as the protector of "junior" Slavic peoples, sends out regular relief aid to other members. While a uniting force amongst our peoples, conservative elements of society argue for a more aggressive approach towards exerting foreign influence and believe that the Federation is more of a liability than a strength.\n\nBeing Kozlov's brainchild, he is unlikely to give it up, but there are rumors of growing discontent amongst its members."
