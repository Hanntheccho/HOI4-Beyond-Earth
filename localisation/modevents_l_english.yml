 newyear_event.2.t: "The 'Superbugs' Crisis"
 newyear_event.2.d: "Over the last four centuries, Earth's population has increased by over nine billion. Unfourtunatly, with the advent of industrialization came mass urbanization, leading to swelling cities forming. Like massive hives, densely populated cities are hotbeds for the spread of diseases.\nAlready, hundreds of once-exotic strains have invaded the bodies of millions, from the ghettos of India, to the modern metropolis of Paris. Even suburban areas are suffering from these viruses, spread by migrants and those trying to escape the cities.\nInnoculations have proven effective at combating the spread, but even industrial powers fear that the superbugs may overwhelm their doctors."
 newyear_event_option.2.a: "Is this the end of the world?"
 newyear_event.3.t: "Debris Storm Clears!"
 newyear_event.3.d: "For the first time in over one-hundred years, significant progress has been made at dissapating the Orbital Debris Storm. After the Great Mistake, most satellites (and the International Space Station) were deemed unsustainable, and were allowed to crash into the Earth. Unfourtunatly, several orbital units instead smashed into one another, producing a 'storm' that circles the planet to this day. The risk of new satellites being destroyed by the debris is so high, that no new space missions were authorized by any nation... until now.\nWith the help of 'Janitor Satellites', small units equiped with lasers, the skeletons of dozens of satellites have already been cleared. Although the project, spearheaded by Professor Juan Carlos of La Paz University, is promising, it will require such funding that can only be provided by world governments and megacorporations."
 newyear_event_option.3.a: "We shall clear the skies!"
 newyear_event.4.t: "Chernobyl Declared Safe!"
 newyear_event.4.d: "More than two centuries ago, Europe suffered one of the worst nuclear meltdowns in history - the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located near Pripyat, Ukraine, exploded due to a flawed reactor design. The surrounding area became irridiated, forcing the locals to relocate, and polluting the air with ash that traveled throughout the continent.\nNow, Ukranian Authorities have declared the Chernobyl area safe from dangerous radiation levels. Already, hundreds of tourists are boarding flights to explore the ruins of humankind's grave mistake. According to one tourism agency in Kiev: 'Chernobyl might as well be the safest place on Earth!"
 newyear_event_option.4.a: "The shadow of Chernobyl passes."
 newyear_event.5.t: "The Ganges river, worse than ever"
 newyear_event.5.d: "The river has been polluted many years by the big industrial conglomerates around it.\n\nOne hundred years ago the river already looked apocalyptic, but at this moment looking at it can even hurt the feelings of many people.\n\nWe do not recommend traveling near this river, neither the international authorities do. Better stay home, stay safe."
 newyear_event_option.5.a: "Sad to hear that"
 newyear_event.6.t: "A deadly heat wave over Europe"
 newyear_event.6.d: "Again, a heat wave has entered southern Europe from Magreb. Europeans, unprepared, have managed to fight it with the biggest reserves of water from the main dams. A few wildfires have been extinguished, but many of them keep destroying what is left of the forests in the mediterranean region.\n\nMore than 12000 deads have been reported, and nation authorities expect it to increase in the next days."
 newyear_event_option.6.a: "The consequences of our mistakes."
 newyear_event.7.t: "The state of the oceans"
 newyear_event.7.d: "Years ago it was a known thing that humankind would have to face the damage it did to the oceans. An increasing acidity was reported as it was damaging the amount of crustaceans all over the world.\n\nThanks to the breakthroughs made in ocean cleaning by the biochemist Miguel O'Hara at the HTRC, this problem has been greatly reduced. We can now keep enjoying eating those delicious crabs."
 newyear_event_option.7.a: "I don't like fish."
