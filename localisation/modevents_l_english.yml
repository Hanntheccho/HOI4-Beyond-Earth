 newyear_event.1.t: "Welcome to the 23rd Century!"
 newyear_event.1.d: "5! 4! 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\nThe clocks across the planet rang out in momentous joy as the streets were filled with the emotional jubilation of a brand-new century. Champagne corks popped in unison and celebration roared across the entire human race. Everyone from the lowly grain-farmer to the multimillionaire executive was now cheering an event that comes once in almost every lifetime. \n\nBeginning in the Pacific, midnight swept westwards, endowing delight but also relief in billions across the world. This was an awfully special centennial for most. The previous century had brought nothing but pain and death. In an almost biblical myth, the world was ravaged by conquests, warfare, famine, and general death. The seas had risen so high that entire cities were swallowed. Traditional governments had been slashed apart by the needs of the masses. Diseases, new and old, had poisoned so many, eliminated entire nations. The number dead... a soul-crushing statistic. Now, these people could finally let go of some of their pent-up grief.\n\nTears, not smiles, were the most common sight on New Year's Day. Humanity had suffered and the planet had suffered with them. But, finally, after so long, things were beginning to look up. Space Exploration has become a glorious and achievable prospect. Human ingenuity has eased much of the unnecessary pain that plagued so many. And, although she has many scars, mother nature seems to be in a relatively stable condition.\n\nThe future is bright as long as we continue to reach for those bright, hopeful stars.\n\nWelcome to the 23rd Century, gentlemen."
 newyear_event_option.1.a: "May it be a prosperous one"
 newyear_event.2.t: "The "Superbugs" Crisis"
 newyear_event.2.d: "Over the last four centuries, Earth's population has increased by over nine billion. Unfourtunatly, with the advent of industrialization came mass urbanization, leading to swelling cities forming. Like massive hives, densely populated cities are hotbeds for the spread of diseases.\n\nAlready, hundreds of once-exotic strains have invaded the bodies of millions, from the ghettos of India, to the modern metropolis of Paris. Even suburban areas are suffering from these viruses, spread by migrants and those trying to escape the cities.\n\nInnoculations have proven effective at combating the spread, but even industrial powers fear that the superbugs may overwhelm their doctors."
 newyear_event_option.2.a: "Is this the end of the world?"
 newyear_event.3.t: "Debris Storm Clears!"
 newyear_event.3.d: "For the first time in over one-hundred years, significant progress has been made at dissapating the Orbital Debris Storm. After the Great Mistake, most satellites (and the International Space Station) were deemed unsustainable, and were allowed to crash into the Earth. Unfourtunatly, several orbital units instead smashed into one another, producing a "storm" that circles the planet to this day. The risk of new satellites being destroyed by the debris is so high, that no new space missions were authorized by any nation... until now.\n\nWith the help of "Janitor Satellites", small units equiped with lasers, the skeletons of dozens of satellites have already been cleared. Although the project, spearheaded by Professor Juan Carlos of La Paz University, is promising, it will require such funding that can only be provided by world governments and megacorporations."
 newyear_event_option.3.a: "We shall clear the skies!"
 newyear_event.4.t: "Chernobyl Declared Safe!"
 newyear_event.4.d: "More than two centuries ago, Europe suffered one of the worst nuclear meltdowns in history - the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located near Pripyat, Ukraine, exploded due to a flawed reactor design. The surrounding area became irridiated, forcing the locals to relocate, and polluting the air with ash that traveled throughout the continent.\n\nNow, Ukranian Authorities have declared the Chernobyl area safe from dangerous radiation levels. Already, hundreds of tourists are boarding flights to explore the ruins of humankind's grave mistake. According to one tourism agency in Kiev: 'Chernobyl might as well be the safest place on Earth!"
 newyear_event_option.4.a: "The shadow of Chernobyl passes."
 newyear_event.5.t: "The Ganges river, toxic disaster"
 newyear_event.5.d: "The Ganges river network has been the main source of water for millions on the Indian subcontinent. Sadly, throughout the recent centuries, the level of pollution has skyrocketed to catastrophic levels with chemical contamination, commercial trash and even bodily excrement making the river uninhabitable to most forms of life.\n\nPrimarily the fault of corrupt government officials and exploitative industrial conglomerates, the river is now far too toxic and hazardous to be around. The scattered remains of animals who lived by or in the river are also a testament to how far removed from its original state that the area has become.\n\nNow with the lower Ganges flooded, removing much of the debris, and much of the dumping reduced, there may indeed be hope for the former lifeline of the Indian subcontinent."
 newyear_event_option.5.a: "Truly, a tragedy"
 newyear_event.6.t: "Another heat wave over Europe"
 newyear_event.6.d: "Experts are in shock today as a record-breaking heatwave moves over Southern Europe. The system has already sparked massive wildfires in southern European countries such as the Balkan Union, Franco-Iberia and the Roman Republic with further fires expected in Padania and even further north.\n\nThe heatwave has put immense strain on the Balkan as well as Franco-Iberian and the Roman Republican populations, killing a reported 5,000 and leaving another 7,000 missing. As a result of these natural disasters, massive refugee movements north have strained the other European nations and weakened many administrations.\n\nEcologists are also warning about the effects of losing many thousands of hectares of forest and how it may affect the already fragile ecosystems.\n\nThe heatwave and fires continue to rage on with it not expected to cease until another couple weeks."
 newyear_event_option.6.a: "The past haunts the future"
 newyear_event.7.t: "The state of our oceans"
 newyear_event.7.d: "The effect of humanity on the Ocean and its biology has been disastrous throughout the centuries. Pre-Great Mistake, it was already on a steep decline. Increasing salinity and acidity had already decimated much of the marine wildlife and left it mostly barren. However, recent scientific developments may have just saved the ocean from the carelessness of humanity's past.\n\nDr. Miguel O'Hara, a biochemist from the High-Tide Research Center, recently proposed a new and relatively cheap system of water treatment that, when implemented on a large enough scale can slowly restore the ocean's pH and salinity to natural levels. Trials of the process in Franco-Iberia show amazing promise and Dr. O'Hara is expected to receive a Nobel prize in the upcoming ceremony in December.\n\nImplemented greatly enough, the vitality of the oceans may be able to be restored and bounties of seafood may be harvested worldwide."
 newyear_event_option.7.a: "But i don't like seafood"
 newyear_event.8.t: "The Gates of Hell keeps burning"
 newyear_event.8.d: "In what was once Turkmenistan, pre-Great Mistake, a great pit of fire rages. Natural gases slowly fume upwards and are set alight, perpetually keeping "The Gates of Hell" alive.\n\nOriginally a site where the old Soviet Union tried drilling for Natural Gas, a cave-in broke open the underground pocket of gas. Attempting to prevent an environmental disaster, the pocket was set alight to prevent the toxic fumes from escaping into the atmosphere.\n\nNow, more than two centuries later, the pit is still burning but the central asian conglomerate, Türkmengaz, has stepped in and announced its plan to finally harness and extract the untapped fossil fuels beneath the pit's surface. To the dismay of tourists, the pit will be sealed, extinguished, and converted into power for the region. For now, it appears fossil fuels live on."
 newyear_event_option.8.a: "Interesting"
 newyear_event.9.t: "The GPGP cleaning"
 newyear_event.9.d: "Pollution has been one of Humanity's most defining marks on the Earth and its surface. Being the largest known body of water and bordering two of the world's most formidable polluting countries, the Pacific Ocean has been left tainted by countless tonnes of refuse and debris. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a constant reminder to the nations of the North Pacific Ocean, as the remnants of centuries-old pollution continue to dash much of their marine enterprising.\n\nHowever, in this new and hopeful age, opportunists and philanthropists see potential in the GPGP. The potential for plastics being fished out and recycled has many entrepreneurs talking, and more efficient technologies and techniques, compared to long ago, see the clean-up of the GPGP as a far more likely prospect."
 newyear_event_option.9.a: "Farewell, Age of Plastic"
 newyear_event.10.t: "The Northern Scorching"
 newyear_event.10.d: "In the far northern hemisphere, a catastrophic situation has been slowly developing. As global temperatures have been slowly increasing over the past several centuries, permafrost coverage in Siberia and even parts of North America have reached dangerously low levels.\n\nIncreased global temperatures has led to an increase of permafrost thawing, releasing greenhouse gases which only serve to speed up the initial, global temperature increase.\n\nNot only that, but wildfires have become more prevalent up in the north as these gases, and the exposed permafrost soil, are extremely flammable. Authorities are struggling to keep up with the increasing number of fires and citizens have often take it upon themselves to fireproof their homes and communities. How long can this continue?"
 newyear_event_option.10.a: "We went down, and the flames went higher"
 newyear_event.11.t: "Tianjin Finance Center Collapses"
 newyear_event.11.d: "At 8:00 a.m. today, SCO surveillance drones reported a terrible event: The Tianjin CTF Finance Center has collapsed! Built in 2019 by the old People's Republic of China, the Center was one of the tallest skyscrapers in the country. Standing at over 1,700 ft, it withstood the rising tide. When the city of Tianjin was consumed by the waves, the Center survived. There it stood for centuries, its tip above the waves.\n\nUnfortunately, the structural integrity of the building could not hold. The churning tide has taken its toll, resulting in the entire building collapsing. Luckily no urban explorers where present at the time. With the end of the Tianjin Finance Center comes the end of an era. Long through a symbol of resiliance amongst the asian peoples, the skyscraper stood defiant against the Great Mistake. But with time, it too fell."
 newyear_event_option.11.a: "A shadow of things to come"
 franco_event.1.t: "Franco-Iberia, a dream come true"
 franco_event.1.d: "After the EU dissolved as different national interests confronted, Iberia and France found common aims, not only economical, but also political and even ideological.\n\nConsidered by itself the last bastion of true democracy and western culture, Franco-Iberia expands beyond its borders with strong economical policies around export and import. It holds most of the market in the mediterranean sea, as well as being the biggest nation with the biggest population, despite it being in average more than 70 years old."
