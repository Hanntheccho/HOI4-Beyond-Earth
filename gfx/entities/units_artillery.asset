#			! INFORMATION !
#
#			Artillery uses three parts: 
#				A frame consisting of an empty scene with 3 joints,
#				2 of which are called "infantry" and "artillery".
#				An artillery gun which is the same for all nationalities.
#				A regular infantry unit.
#				
#			The artillery gun and infantry unit attaches to the different joints on the frame (artillery and infantry) and it will use
#			a certain infantry unit depending on what country specific artillery entity it is attached to.
#
#			Artillery gun animations can be found at: models/buildings/animation.asset
#			Artillery gun and frame meshes can be found at: models/buildings/buildings.gfx
#			Infantry entities can be found at: gfx/entities/units_infantry.asset


# This is the generic artillery/infantry entity (no country specific).
